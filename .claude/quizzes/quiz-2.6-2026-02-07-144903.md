## Question 1
What is bonus depreciation?

A) A method that accelerates regular MACRS depreciation over time
B) An additional first-year deduction taken on top of regular depreciation
C) A special depreciation rate only available for buildings
D) A depreciation method that replaces MACRS for certain assets

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Bonus depreciation is an additional first-year deduction taken on top of regular MACRS depreciation, not a method that accelerates the regular depreciation itself. It allows immediate expensing of a percentage (now permanently 100% under OBBBA 2025) of an asset's cost in the first year the asset is placed in service. After the bonus depreciation is taken, the remaining basis is then depreciated using the normal MACRS method. This provides a powerful front-loaded tax benefit for qualifying property.

## Question 2
Which of the following property types generally qualifies for bonus depreciation?

A) Commercial buildings with 39-year recovery periods
B) Residential rental property with 27.5-year recovery periods
C) Office furniture and equipment with 7-year recovery periods
D) All real property regardless of recovery period

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Bonus depreciation generally applies to assets with recovery periods of 20 years or less. Office furniture and equipment are classified as 7-year property, which qualifies for bonus depreciation. Under the OBBBA of 2025, property acquired after January 19, 2025, is eligible for permanent 100% bonus depreciation. In contrast, commercial buildings (39-year) and residential rental property (27.5-year) are real property that do not qualify for bonus depreciation due to their longer recovery periods.

## Question 3
Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025, what is the bonus depreciation rate for property acquired after January 19, 2025?

A) 40% with scheduled phase-out
B) 80% permanent rate
C) 100% permanent rate
D) 60% declining to 0% by 2027

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 permanently restored 100% bonus depreciation for property acquired after January 19, 2025. This represents a major change from the previous law, which had a phase-down schedule (80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, 40% in 2025, etc.). The permanent 100% rate applies to qualifying property with recovery periods of 20 years or less and has no sunset provisions, providing long-term certainty for tax planning and capital investment decisions.

## Question 4
A business purchases and places in service $500,000 of qualifying 5-year equipment on February 1, 2025. What bonus depreciation rate applies to this purchase?

A) 100% because it was placed in service in 2025
B) 40% based on the 2025 phase-down schedule
C) 100% because it was acquired after January 19, 2025
D) 60% carried over from the 2024 rate

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: While you correctly identified that the equipment qualifies for 100% bonus depreciation, the specific reason is critical. The OBBBA of 2025 permanently restored 100% bonus depreciation for property **acquired after January 19, 2025**. Since this equipment was purchased and placed in service on February 1, 2025 (after the January 19, 2025 cutoff date), it qualifies for the permanent 100% bonus rate. Property acquired between January 1-19, 2025, would have only received 40% bonus depreciation under the phase-down schedule. The precise acquisition date relative to January 19, 2025, is what determines eligibility, not just being placed in service during 2025.

## Question 5
A manufacturing company completes a cost segregation study on a building purchased in 2024 and identifies $2 million in 5-year and 7-year property. They implement the study in March 2026. What bonus depreciation rate applies to the reclassified property?

A) 40% because the building was purchased in 2024
B) 0% because cost segregation studies don't qualify for bonus depreciation
C) 100% because the property is being placed in service (reclassified) after January 19, 2025
D) 60% based on the building's original 2024 purchase date

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: D ✓
**Explanation**: When a cost segregation study is performed on an existing building, the reclassified components (5-year and 7-year property) are treated as having been placed in service when the building was originally placed in service, not when the study is completed. Since the building was purchased and placed in service in 2024, the reclassified property is eligible for the 2024 bonus depreciation rate of 60%. The catch-up depreciation is captured through a §481(a) adjustment when filing Form 3115 for the change in accounting method. The implementation date of the study doesn't change the placed-in-service date for bonus depreciation purposes.

## Question 6
Why is the permanent 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 considered particularly valuable for businesses compared to the previous phase-out schedule?

A) It eliminates the need for cost segregation studies entirely
B) It provides long-term certainty for capital investment planning without sunset provisions
C) It applies to all property types including buildings with 39-year lives
D) It increases the recovery periods for qualifying property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The permanent nature of the 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 is its most significant advantage. Previous bonus depreciation provisions were temporary and subject to phase-outs or expiration, creating uncertainty for businesses planning capital investments. The OBBBA's permanent 100% bonus with no sunset provisions provides long-term certainty, allowing businesses to make multi-year investment decisions with confidence that the tax benefit will remain available. This eliminates the legislative risk that previously required businesses to accelerate purchases or face reduced tax benefits under phase-down schedules.

## Question 7
A real estate investor is considering whether to conduct a cost segregation study on a commercial building purchased on March 15, 2025, and placed in service on April 1, 2025. What bonus depreciation considerations should influence their decision?

A) The property acquired before January 19, 2025, qualifies for only 40% bonus
B) The property placed in service after January 19, 2025, qualifies for 100% permanent bonus on identified personal property
C) Cost segregation provides no bonus depreciation benefit since the building is commercial real property
D) The timing doesn't matter because all 2025 property receives the same bonus rate

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Timing is critical in 2025! Property acquired between January 1-19, 2025, was only eligible for 40% bonus depreciation under the phase-down schedule. However, this property was both purchased (March 15) and placed in service (April 1) after January 19, 2025, making it eligible for the permanent 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA. A cost segregation study would identify 5-year, 7-year, and 15-year personal property components that qualify for 100% first-year bonus depreciation, providing substantial tax benefits. While the building itself (39-year property) doesn't qualify for bonus depreciation, the shorter-life components identified through cost segregation do qualify.

## Question 8
A business owner is comparing the tax benefits of purchasing equipment in late 2024 versus early 2026. The equipment costs $1 million and has a 7-year recovery period. Considering bonus depreciation rates, OBBBA provisions, and the increased Section 179 limits ($2.5 million), which strategy maximizes the first-year deduction?

A) Purchase in late 2024 to receive 60% bonus plus Section 179 ($1M limit)
B) Purchase in early 2026 to receive 100% bonus or use Section 179 ($2.5M limit)
C) Split the purchase between 2024 and 2026 to average the rates
D) Purchase in January 2025 to receive transitional benefits

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Purchasing in early 2026 (after January 19, 2025) maximizes benefits and flexibility. The equipment would qualify for 100% bonus depreciation automatically, providing a $1 million first-year deduction without needing to make any election. Alternatively, the business could use Section 179 expensing, which OBBBA increased from $1 million to $2.5 million for taxable years beginning after 2024. While the $1 million equipment could have been fully expensed in late 2024 using the full Section 179 limit ($1M) or combined with 60% bonus, the 2026 purchase provides both 100% automatic bonus depreciation and the flexibility of a much higher Section 179 limit if needed for other purchases. The permanent nature of the 100% bonus also eliminates concerns about future phase-downs.

## Question 9
How should a tax advisor explain the interaction between cost segregation studies and the OBBBA's permanent 100% bonus depreciation to a client who acquired a $10 million commercial building on March 1, 2025?

A) Cost segregation is no longer beneficial since the building qualifies for 100% bonus depreciation
B) Cost segregation identifies qualifying personal property (5, 7, 15-year) that receives 100% first-year bonus, while the building structure (39-year) receives standard depreciation
C) The building should be held until 2027 when better bonus depreciation rates become available
D) OBBBA eliminated the need to segregate assets into different recovery periods

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is exactly how cost segregation works with OBBBA's 100% bonus depreciation. The commercial building structure itself remains 39-year property that doesn't qualify for bonus depreciation. However, a cost segregation study identifies components with shorter recovery periods (5-year property like carpeting and appliances, 7-year property like furniture and fixtures, and 15-year property like land improvements and QIP) that qualify for 100% first-year bonus depreciation since they have recovery periods of 20 years or less. For a $10 million building, a cost segregation study might identify $2-4 million in qualifying personal property, resulting in substantial first-year deductions. The permanent 100% bonus under OBBBA makes cost segregation even more valuable by guaranteeing the maximum deduction without phase-down concerns.

## Question 10
A multinational corporation is developing a 5-year capital expenditure plan for U.S. operations. How does the permanent nature of 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA fundamentally change their tax planning approach compared to the previous phase-out regime?

A) They can now ignore depreciation entirely and focus only on Section 179
B) They can confidently plan multi-year equipment investments without factoring in declining bonus rates or sunset provisions
C) They must accelerate all purchases to 2025 before the law changes
D) They should delay purchases since bonus depreciation rates will increase in future years

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the fundamental strategic advantage of permanent 100% bonus depreciation. Under the previous phase-out regime (80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, declining to 0% by 2027+), corporations had to rush capital investments to capture higher bonus rates before they phased down, creating artificial pressure on timing decisions. With OBBBA's permanent 100% bonus with no sunset provisions, companies can now plan 5-year (or longer) capital expenditure programs based on actual business needs, operational requirements, and economic factors rather than trying to "beat the clock" on declining tax benefits. This provides tremendous strategic flexibility and eliminates the legislative risk that previously complicated long-term capital planning.
