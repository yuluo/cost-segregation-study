## Question 1
What is the de minimis safe harbor threshold for taxpayers WITH an Applicable Financial Statement (AFS)?

A) $2,500 per invoice or item
B) $5,000 per invoice or item
C) $10,000 per invoice or item
D) $1,000 per invoice or item

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The de minimis safe harbor allows taxpayers with an Applicable Financial Statement (AFS) to expense amounts up to $5,000 per invoice or item, while taxpayers without AFS are limited to $2,500. This safe harbor requires a written accounting policy to be in place at the beginning of the tax year.

## Question 2
Which requirement is mandatory for a taxpayer to utilize the de minimis safe harbor?

A) The taxpayer must have gross receipts under $10 million
B) The taxpayer must file Form 3115 with the IRS
C) The taxpayer must have a written accounting policy in place at the beginning of the tax year
D) The taxpayer must perform a cost segregation study

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: A critical requirement for the de minimis safe harbor is that the taxpayer must have a written accounting policy in place at the beginning of the tax year. This policy must be established before the tax year begins to qualify for the safe harbor treatment. Options A relates to the small taxpayer safe harbor, B is not required for de minimis (though Form 3115 may be needed for other accounting method changes), and D is unrelated to the safe harbor requirement.

## Question 3
The routine maintenance safe harbor allows expensing of maintenance activities that the taxpayer reasonably expects to perform how many times during an asset's class life?

A) At least once every 5 years
B) More than once during the asset's class life
C) At least three times during the asset's class life
D) Exactly twice during the asset's class life

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: The routine maintenance safe harbor applies to activities that the taxpayer reasonably expects to perform **more than once** during the asset's class life, OR more than once in 10 years for buildings. The "more than once" standard means at least twice—there's no specific 5-year requirement. This safe harbor covers activities that keep property in ordinarily efficient operating condition, such as cleaning, inspection, testing, and replacing parts.

## Question 4
A small business with average gross receipts of $8 million over the prior 3 years owns a building with an unadjusted basis of $900,000. They incurred $25,000 in repairs and improvements this year. Can they use the safe harbor for small taxpayers?

A) Yes, because their gross receipts are under $10 million
B) No, because their repair costs exceed the lesser of $10,000 or 2% of building basis
C) Yes, because their building basis is under $1 million
D) No, because they must file Form 3115 first

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: While the business meets two criteria (gross receipts under $10 million and building basis under $1 million), they fail the third requirement. Total annual repair and improvement costs must not exceed the **lesser of** $10,000 or 2% of the building's unadjusted basis. Here, 2% of $900,000 = $18,000, so the lesser amount is $10,000. Since their costs of $25,000 exceed this $10,000 threshold, they cannot use the safe harbor for small taxpayers.

## Question 5
A taxpayer without an AFS purchases office supplies for $2,800 on a single invoice. The invoice shows: 10 chairs at $150 each ($1,500), 5 desks at $200 each ($1,000), and 6 lamps at $50 each ($300). How should this be treated under the de minimis safe harbor?

A) The entire $2,800 can be expensed because it's under $5,000
B) Each item type can be expensed separately since each line item is under $2,500
C) Nothing can be expensed because the total invoice exceeds $2,500
D) Only the lamps can be expensed because they're the only line under $500

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The de minimis safe harbor is applied **per invoice line item** or per item as substantiated by the invoice, not to the total invoice amount. For taxpayers without an AFS, the threshold is $2,500 per line item. In this case, each line item (chairs: $1,500, desks: $1,000, lamps: $300) is below the $2,500 threshold, so all items can be expensed under the de minimis safe harbor. This line-by-line application is a key advantage of the safe harbor.

## Question 6
A commercial property owner replaces worn carpet in tenant spaces every 7 years. The building's class life is 39 years. Which safe harbor would most likely apply to the carpet replacement costs?

A) De minimis safe harbor, if each invoice is under the threshold
B) Routine maintenance safe harbor, since it's performed more than once in 10 years
C) Safe harbor for small taxpayers, if gross receipts qualify
D) No safe harbor applies; this must be capitalized as an improvement

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The routine maintenance safe harbor applies to activities the taxpayer reasonably expects to perform more than once during the asset's class life, **or** more than once in 10 years for buildings. Since the carpet is replaced every 7 years, it will be replaced multiple times within the building's 39-year class life, and more than once within any 10-year period. This qualifies as routine maintenance that keeps the property in ordinarily efficient operating condition. The de minimis safe harbor (A) wouldn't typically apply as carpet replacement costs usually exceed the thresholds, and the small taxpayer safe harbor (C) has specific eligibility requirements beyond just qualifying gross receipts.

## Question 7
A landlord owns a building with an unadjusted basis of $800,000 and has average annual gross receipts of $9 million. This year they spent $18,000 on qualifying repairs and improvements. What is the maximum amount they can expense under the safe harbor for small taxpayers?

A) $0 - they don't qualify because costs exceed the threshold
B) $10,000 - the lesser of $10,000 or 2% of basis
C) $16,000 - 2% of the building's unadjusted basis
D) $18,000 - the full amount of their repair costs

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: A ✗
**Explanation**: The safe harbor for small taxpayers is an all-or-nothing election. To qualify, total annual repair and improvement costs must not **exceed** the lesser of $10,000 or 2% of the building's unadjusted basis. Here, 2% of $800,000 = $16,000, so the lesser amount is $10,000. Since the landlord spent $18,000, which exceeds the $10,000 threshold, they do not qualify for the safe harbor at all and cannot expense any amount under this provision. The entire $18,000 would need to be analyzed under normal capitalization rules (BAR tests, etc.).

## Question 8
A taxpayer is considering whether to use the de minimis safe harbor or classify certain items as materials and supplies. Both have similar dollar thresholds. What is a key strategic difference between these two approaches in the context of cost segregation?

A) The de minimis safe harbor provides immediate expensing, while materials and supplies must be capitalized
B) Materials and supplies require more documentation than the de minimis safe harbor
C) The de minimis safe harbor requires a written policy in advance, while materials and supplies classification is determined at purchase
D) Materials and supplies can only be used by taxpayers with AFS, while de minimis is available to all taxpayers

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: A critical strategic difference is the timing and planning requirement. The de minimis safe harbor requires a **written accounting policy to be in place at the beginning of the tax year**—you must plan ahead and adopt this policy before the year starts. In contrast, materials and supplies classification is based on the nature of the items and can be determined at the time of purchase based on whether they meet the definition (components acquired to maintain/repair tangible property, items consumed in operations, etc.). This advance planning requirement for de minimis makes it less flexible but provides certainty, while materials and supplies classification offers more flexibility in application.

## Question 9
In the context of bonus depreciation phasing out (scheduled to reach 0% by 2027 under pre-OBBBA law), how do the three safe harbors interact with cost segregation strategy for small businesses facing increased capitalization burdens?

A) Safe harbors become less valuable as bonus depreciation phases out, since immediate expensing options decrease
B) Safe harbors become more valuable as bonus depreciation phases out, providing alternative immediate expensing opportunities
C) Safe harbors are unrelated to bonus depreciation and provide no strategic value
D) Only the routine maintenance safe harbor has value when bonus depreciation is unavailable

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is a critical strategic insight. As bonus depreciation phases out, the difference between immediate expensing and capitalizing becomes much more significant. When bonus was at 100%, capitalizing an item still provided immediate tax benefits. But as it phases down (60% in 2024, 40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, 0% in 2027 under original TCJA), capitalized items increasingly must be depreciated over their full recovery periods (5, 7, 15, or 39 years). This makes the three safe harbors **more valuable** as alternative paths to immediate expensing. The de minimis safe harbor ($2,500/$5,000), routine maintenance safe harbor, and safe harbor for small taxpayers all provide opportunities to expense costs immediately rather than capitalizing them, which becomes increasingly advantageous as bonus depreciation disappears.

## Question 10
A cost segregation professional is advising a client who owns a $950,000 building and has $12,000 in annual repairs. The client has average gross receipts of $9.5 million. The repairs include: $8,000 for HVAC maintenance (performed every 3 years), $2,400 for replacing light fixtures (individual fixtures are $120 each, 20 fixtures on one invoice), and $1,600 for painting (performed every 8 years). What combination of safe harbors would optimize the tax treatment?

A) Use small taxpayer safe harbor for everything since the building basis and gross receipts qualify
B) Use routine maintenance safe harbor for HVAC and painting; use de minimis for light fixtures
C) Use de minimis safe harbor for all items since they're under the thresholds
D) Capitalize everything since total costs exceed $10,000

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: This question tests the strategic application of multiple safe harbors. While the **small taxpayer safe harbor** doesn't work (total costs of $12,000 exceed the $10,000 threshold), the client can optimize by using different safe harbors for different expenses:

- **Routine maintenance safe harbor**: HVAC maintenance (every 3 years) and painting (every 8 years) both qualify as activities performed more than once in 10 years → expense $8,000 + $1,600 = $9,600
- **De minimis safe harbor**: Each light fixture is $120, well under both the $2,500 (no AFS) and $5,000 (with AFS) thresholds when applied per item → expense $2,400

By strategically combining safe harbors, the professional can help the client expense all $12,000 immediately rather than capitalizing. This demonstrates the importance of analyzing each expenditure individually and applying the most appropriate safe harbor, rather than defaulting to capitalization when one safe harbor doesn't fit all items.
