## Question 5
A taxpayer has been depreciating a commercial building over 39 years using straight-line on their 2024 and 2025 tax returns. They now want to conduct a cost segregation study. What complication arises from the Two Consecutive Year Rule?

A) The taxpayer must wait until 2027 to perform the study

## Question 7
A building contains: (1) computers in a server room, (2) office desks and chairs, (3) parking lot, and (4) the HVAC system serving the entire building. A cost segregation study would most likely reclassify which from 39-year to a shorter life?

A) Only the HVAC system, because it is mechanical equipment
B) Computers, office desks, and parking lot — but NOT the HVAC system

D) Only the computers and parking lot

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓

B) GDS and ADS use the same recovery periods but different conventions. ADS is required for all residential property.
C) GDS applies only to personal property; ADS applies only to real property. ADS is required for foreign-use property.
D) GDS uses straight-line; ADS uses declining balance. ADS is optional and never required.

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: GDS uses accelerated depreciation with shorter recovery periods. ADS uses straight-line with longer periods and is required for tax-exempt use property and Section 163(j) elections.
