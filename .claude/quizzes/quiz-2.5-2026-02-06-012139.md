## Question 1
What is the primary defining characteristic that makes an improvement qualify as Qualified Improvement Property (QIP)?

A) The improvement must be made to a building less than 3 years old
B) The improvement must be interior work made after the building was originally placed in service
C) The improvement must be made pursuant to a lease agreement
D) The improvement must be for restaurant or retail use exclusively

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) is defined as interior improvements to non-residential buildings that are made after the building was originally placed in service. This distinguishes QIP from new construction or improvements made during initial building construction. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025, QIP placed in service after January 19, 2025, qualifies for permanent 100% bonus depreciation with a 15-year recovery period.

## Question 2
Which of the following improvements would NOT qualify as Qualified Improvement Property (QIP)?

A) New interior partitions and walls (non-structural)
B) Installation of a new elevator in an existing building
C) Replacement of interior flooring and ceiling tiles
D) New interior lighting and electrical upgrades

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Elevators and escalators are specifically excluded from the definition of Qualified Improvement Property, even if installed in an existing building. The other improvements listed (interior partitions, flooring, ceiling tiles, lighting, and electrical upgrades) would generally qualify as QIP as long as they are interior improvements made after the building was originally placed in service and don't involve enlargement or internal structural framework modifications.

## Question 3
What recovery period applies to Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) under current tax law?

A) 5 years
B) 7 years
C) 15 years
D) 39 years

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) has a 15-year recovery period under MACRS. This was originally intended in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and a technical correction in the CARES Act (2020) confirmed this classification. The 15-year recovery period makes QIP eligible for bonus depreciation. Under the OBBBA of 2025, QIP placed in service after January 19, 2025, now qualifies for permanent 100% bonus depreciation, providing significant tax benefits for interior building improvements.

## Question 4
A commercial office building was originally placed in service in 2020. In 2026, the owner renovates the lobby by removing and replacing interior walls, upgrading lighting fixtures, installing new flooring, and adding a new freight elevator. Which components would qualify as QIP?

A) All components qualify because they're all interior improvements
B) Only the walls, lighting, and flooring qualify; the elevator is excluded
C) Only the elevator qualifies because it's a capital improvement
D) None qualify because the building is less than 10 years old

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Since the building was placed in service in 2020 and the improvements are being made in 2026 (after the building was placed in service), the interior improvements generally qualify as QIP. However, elevators and escalators are specifically excluded from QIP classification, even when installed in existing buildings. Therefore, the interior walls, lighting fixtures, and flooring would qualify as QIP with a 15-year recovery period and 100% bonus depreciation eligibility (under OBBBA 2025), while the freight elevator would need to be classified separately and depreciated over 39 years as part of the building's structural components.

## Question 5
A taxpayer owns a retail building that was originally placed in service in 2022. In 2026, they make $500,000 of qualifying interior improvements. Which of the following Section 179 expensing categories could potentially apply to these improvements?

A) Roofs, HVAC systems, fire protection and alarm systems, and security systems
B) Only roofs and HVAC systems
C) Only fire protection and security systems
D) Section 179 cannot be used for any building improvements

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: A ✗
**Explanation**: Under Section 179 expensing rules, qualified improvements to non-residential real property include roofs, HVAC systems, fire protection and alarm systems, and security systems. All four categories are eligible for immediate Section 179 expensing (subject to annual dollar limits). Under the OBBBA of 2025, the Section 179 maximum deduction increased from $1 million to $2.5 million, and the phaseout threshold increased from $2.5 million to $4 million for taxable years beginning after 2024, making this expensing option even more valuable for building improvements.

## Question 6
Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Qualified Leasehold Improvements (QLI), Qualified Restaurant Property (QRP), and Qualified Retail Improvement Property (QRIP) were separate categories. What happened to these categories after 2017?

A) They were eliminated entirely and no longer receive favorable tax treatment
B) They were consolidated into the broader Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) category
C) They remained as separate categories with different recovery periods
D) They were reclassified as 5-year property instead of 15-year property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 consolidated the historical categories of Qualified Leasehold Improvements (QLI), Qualified Restaurant Property (QRP), and Qualified Retail Improvement Property (QRIP) into the broader Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) category, effective January 1, 2018. This simplification eliminated the need to meet specific requirements for leases, restaurant use percentages, or building age. Now, all interior improvements to non-residential buildings made after the building is placed in service can potentially qualify as QIP with a 15-year recovery period and bonus depreciation eligibility, providing similar tax benefits with simplified requirements.

## Question 7
A restaurant owner is planning a $750,000 renovation of their existing restaurant building in 2026, including new kitchen equipment, interior dining area remodel, new HVAC system, and replacement of the building's exterior doors and windows. How should they approach the tax treatment of these improvements?

A) All components qualify as QIP since it's a restaurant renovation
B) Separate QIP-eligible interior improvements from exterior components and equipment, which have different classifications
C) Everything must be depreciated over 39 years as building improvements
D) Only the kitchen equipment qualifies for accelerated depreciation

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Proper tax planning requires careful separation of improvement components based on their classification. The interior dining area remodel and HVAC system could qualify as QIP (15-year, bonus depreciation eligible). The kitchen equipment would be classified as personal property (typically 5-year or 7-year property) and also bonus depreciation eligible. The exterior doors and windows are not interior improvements, so they don't qualify as QIP and would typically be depreciated over 39 years as part of the building. Working with a cost segregation specialist helps maximize tax benefits by properly identifying and tracking each component's classification. Under OBBBA 2025, both QIP and qualifying personal property can receive 100% bonus depreciation if placed in service after January 19, 2025.

## Question 8
A commercial building owner is considering whether to make $2 million in interior improvements in late 2025 or wait until 2026. The improvements will all qualify as QIP. Given the changes under OBBBA 2025, what is the most critical factor in their timing decision?

A) Whether the improvements are acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025, to qualify for permanent 100% bonus depreciation
B) Waiting until 2027 when bonus depreciation fully expires to spread deductions over time
C) The building must be at least 3 years old before QIP treatment applies
D) QIP only qualifies for bonus depreciation in odd-numbered years

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 permanently restored 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property, including QIP, that is acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025. This represents a major change from the previous phasedown schedule that would have provided only 40% bonus in 2025 and 20% in 2026. Since both late 2025 and 2026 fall after the critical January 19, 2025 date, both timing options would qualify for the permanent 100% bonus depreciation. The owner should focus on other factors like cash flow needs, project readiness, and business considerations rather than tax timing, since the 100% bonus benefit is now permanent with no scheduled expiration.

## Question 9
A taxpayer is planning $3.5 million in qualifying interior improvements to their commercial building in 2026. They want to maximize first-year deductions. Which combination of tax strategies should they consider?

A) Only use bonus depreciation since it provides 100% expensing
B) Use Section 179 expensing first (up to $2.5 million), then apply 100% bonus depreciation to remaining amounts
C) Depreciate everything over 15 years to spread the deduction and avoid AMT issues
D) Section 179 and bonus depreciation cannot be combined on the same property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Taxpayers can strategically combine Section 179 expensing and bonus depreciation to maximize tax benefits. Under OBBBA 2025, the Section 179 maximum deduction increased to $2.5 million (with a $4 million phase-out threshold). For $3.5 million in improvements, the taxpayer could elect Section 179 expensing for up to $2.5 million, then apply 100% bonus depreciation to the remaining $1 million. This strategy provides flexibility because Section 179 is elective and subject to taxable income limitations, while bonus depreciation is automatic (unless elected out) and has no income limitation. In this case, since the total investment ($3.5M) is under the $4M phase-out threshold, the full $2.5M Section 179 amount would be available. This layered approach gives the taxpayer control over timing and amount of deductions based on their specific tax situation.

## Question 10
Why is it strategically important to work with cost segregation specialists when planning QIP improvements, rather than simply treating all interior improvement costs as a single QIP asset?

A) The IRS requires a formal cost segregation study for any QIP over $100,000
B) Different components may have different classifications (QIP vs. personal property vs. structural) with varying recovery periods and tax benefits
C) QIP improvements can only be claimed if documented in a professional study
D) Cost segregation is only beneficial for new construction, not for improvements

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: A comprehensive cost segregation study is valuable for QIP improvements because renovation projects typically include multiple component types with different tax classifications. For example, a $2 million interior renovation might include personal property items like furniture and equipment (5-year or 7-year), QIP-eligible interior improvements (15-year with 100% bonus), and structural components or excluded items like elevators (39-year). A cost segregation specialist can identify and properly classify each component, potentially accelerating depreciation on personal property beyond the QIP treatment and maximizing the combination of Section 179 expensing, bonus depreciation, and regular MACRS depreciation. This detailed analysis can provide significantly greater tax benefits than simply treating the entire project as a single QIP asset.
