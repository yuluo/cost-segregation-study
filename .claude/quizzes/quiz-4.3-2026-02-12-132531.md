## Question 1
What is the Unit of Property (UOP) in the context of tangible property regulations?

A) The smallest component that can be separately depreciated
B) An asset where all components are functionally interdependent
C) Any asset with a cost exceeding $5,000
D) The building structure excluding all building systems

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: A Unit of Property (UOP) is generally defined as an asset where all components are "functionally interdependent" - meaning one part cannot work without the others. All interdependent parts are treated as a single unit. This is the foundational concept that determines the baseline asset being worked on when evaluating whether an expenditure is a repair or an improvement.

## Question 2
According to the tangible property regulations, how many specifically enumerated building systems are identified for capitalization analysis purposes?

A) Seven systems
B) Eight systems
C) Nine systems
D) Twelve systems

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The tangible property regulations specifically enumerate nine building systems for capitalization analysis purposes. These nine systems are: (1) HVAC, (2) Plumbing, (3) Electrical, (4) Escalators, (5) Elevators, (6) Fire protection and alarm systems, (7) Security systems, (8) Gas distribution system, and (9) Other systems identified in regulations. Understanding these nine systems is critical because capitalization rules are applied at the level of each individual system, not just the building as a whole.

## Question 3
Why is the Unit of Property considered the "critical factor" in repair versus improvement analysis?

A) It determines the depreciation method to be used
B) It establishes the threshold for Section 179 expensing
C) It defines the baseline asset and changes the scope of what constitutes a replacement versus repair
D) It identifies whether bonus depreciation is available

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The Unit of Property is called the "critical factor" because it defines the baseline asset being worked on and fundamentally changes the scope of what constitutes a "replacement" versus a "repair". For example, if the UOP is defined as an entire HVAC system, replacing a compressor would be a repair of the system. However, if the UOP were defined as the compressor itself, the same work would be a full replacement requiring capitalization. This demonstrates why UOP determination is so critical to the repair/improvement analysis.

## Question 4
A taxpayer replaces the entire rooftop HVAC unit on a commercial building. The building has three separate HVAC systems serving different zones. How should the Unit of Property be defined for this expenditure?

A) The entire building including all three HVAC systems
B) Each individual HVAC system as a separate UOP
C) The specific rooftop unit being replaced
D) All HVAC components across all three systems combined

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the tangible property regulations, each of the nine specifically enumerated building systems is treated as a separate Unit of Property. When a building has multiple systems of the same type (such as three HVAC systems serving different zones), each system is a separate UOP. This means replacing one entire rooftop HVAC unit would be evaluated as a replacement of that specific system, not a repair to it. This distinction is crucial for determining whether the expenditure must be capitalized under the improvement rules.

## Question 5
A hotel owner replaces the compressor in one of the building's elevator systems. The elevator has multiple interdependent components including the motor, cables, car, and control system. What is the Unit of Property for analyzing this expenditure?

A) The compressor itself
B) The entire elevator system
C) All elevators in the building combined
D) The building structure

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The entire elevator system is the Unit of Property because all components (motor, cables, car, control system, compressor, etc.) are functionally interdependent - they cannot operate without each other. Elevators are one of the nine specifically enumerated building systems, and each elevator is treated as a separate UOP. Therefore, replacing just the compressor would be analyzed as a repair or improvement to the elevator system as a whole, not as a complete replacement. This UOP definition significantly impacts whether the expenditure can be expensed as a repair or must be capitalized as an improvement.

## Question 6
A manufacturing facility replaces damaged exterior walls after a storm. Under the tangible property regulations, how should the building structure be treated for UOP analysis?

A) Each wall is a separate UOP
B) The exterior envelope is separate from the interior structure
C) The entire building structure (envelope and frame) is generally a single UOP
D) Only the damaged portion is considered the UOP

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Under the tangible property regulations, the building structure (including both the envelope and frame) is generally treated as a single Unit of Property. However, capitalization rules are applied at two distinct levels: (1) the building structure as a whole, and (2) each of the nine specifically enumerated building systems separately. This means that when analyzing the wall replacement, you would evaluate whether it improves the building structure UOP, not whether it replaces individual components. This broad UOP definition for building structures is a key concept in repair versus improvement analysis.

## Question 7
A retail store replaces the fire alarm control panel but leaves all existing smoke detectors, sprinkler heads, and piping in place. The work costs $15,000. How should this expenditure be analyzed under the UOP framework?

A) The control panel is the UOP, so this is a complete replacement requiring capitalization
B) The entire fire protection and alarm system is the UOP, so this is evaluated as a potential repair to the system
C) Since it's under the de minimis safe harbor, it can be automatically expensed
D) The building is the UOP, so this is evaluated as a building improvement

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Fire protection and alarm systems are one of the nine specifically enumerated building systems, and the entire system (including control panels, smoke detectors, sprinklers, piping, etc.) constitutes a single Unit of Property based on functional interdependence. Since only the control panel is being replaced while all other components remain, this is not a replacement of the entire UOP. Instead, it must be evaluated under the BAR tests (Betterment, Adaptation, Restoration) to determine if it's a repair (deductible) or an improvement (capitalizable) to the fire protection system. The UOP framework is what allows this partial replacement to potentially qualify as a deductible repair rather than requiring automatic capitalization.

## Question 8
A taxpayer owns a mixed-use building with both retail space and apartments. The retail area has a separate HVAC system from the residential units, which share a different HVAC system. The taxpayer wants to perform work on the retail HVAC system. How does the UOP concept interact with the two-level capitalization analysis for this scenario?

A) Both HVAC systems must be analyzed together as they're in the same building structure
B) The retail HVAC system is analyzed separately as its own UOP, independent of both the building structure UOP and the residential HVAC system UOP
C) Only the building structure UOP matters; individual systems are irrelevant
D) The UOP must include all mechanical systems to properly evaluate functional interdependence

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This scenario demonstrates the two-level capitalization framework: (1) the building structure is one UOP, and (2) each of the nine enumerated building systems is a separate UOP. The retail HVAC system and residential HVAC system are distinct systems serving different functional areas, making them separate Units of Property. Work on the retail HVAC system would be evaluated only against that specific system's UOP - not combined with the residential system, and separately from the building structure analysis. This multi-level UOP framework allows for granular repair versus improvement determinations while maintaining clear boundaries between different building systems.

## Question 9
Consider IRC Section 263(a) and the tangible property regulations effective since 2014. A taxpayer argues that replacing 40% of a building's electrical system components should be treated as a repair because the entire system wasn't replaced. How does the UOP concept impact this argument in the context of cost segregation planning?

A) The argument succeeds because partial replacements under 50% are always repairs
B) The argument requires analysis under the BAR tests since the electrical system UOP wasn't fully replaced, but the expenditure may still require capitalization if it betters or restores the system
C) The argument fails because any work on enumerated systems must be capitalized regardless of scope
D) The UOP concept doesn't apply since electrical systems are not considered real property for depreciation purposes

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This question synthesizes multiple concepts: UOP framework, IRC §263(a) improvement rules, and cost segregation implications. Since the electrical system is the UOP and only 40% of components were replaced (not the entire system), this is not an automatic full replacement requiring capitalization. However, it must still be analyzed under the BAR tests (Betterment, Adaptation, Restoration) to determine if the work improves the electrical system UOP. For cost segregation planning, this distinction is critical: if the work qualifies as a repair, it's immediately deductible; if it's an improvement, it may need to be capitalized but could potentially qualify for accelerated depreciation as 5, 7, or 15-year property depending on the specific components. The UOP framework prevents automatic capitalization while still requiring rigorous improvement analysis.

## Question 10
A cost segregation professional is evaluating a client's building renovation that involved work on the plumbing system, security system, and building foundation. The client wants to maximize current-year deductions. How should the professional apply the UOP framework to optimize the tax treatment while maintaining compliance with the tangible property regulations?

A) Combine all systems into a single analysis to simplify the evaluation and expense everything under the $2,500 de minimis safe harbor
B) Analyze each system as a separate UOP (plumbing, security, foundation/structure), apply BAR tests independently to each, and identify which expenditures qualify as repairs versus improvements requiring capitalization with potential cost segregation benefits
C) Treat the entire building as one UOP to maximize the chance that partial replacements qualify as repairs
D) Apply the improvement standards only to the building structure and automatically expense all building system work

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This synthesis question requires integrating UOP framework, repair regulations, and cost segregation strategy. The correct approach is to: (1) Recognize that plumbing and security systems are each separate UOPs from the nine enumerated systems, while the foundation is part of the building structure UOP; (2) Apply BAR tests independently to each UOP to determine if work constitutes a repair (immediate deduction) or improvement (capitalization required); (3) For any improvements requiring capitalization, perform cost segregation analysis to identify components qualifying for accelerated depreciation (5, 7, or 15-year property vs. 27.5/39-year building property). This granular approach maximizes legitimate current-year deductions through proper repair classification while capturing accelerated depreciation benefits on required capitalizations. Combining systems (Answer A) or treating the building as one UOP (Answer C) would fail to apply the regulations correctly and could miss planning opportunities or create audit risk.
