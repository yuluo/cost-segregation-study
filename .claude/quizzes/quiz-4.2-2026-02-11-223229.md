## Question 1
Under IRC Section 162(a), which characteristic allows a cost to be deducted as a repair expense?

A) The cost materially increases the property's fair market value
B) The cost keeps property in an ordinarily efficient operating condition
C) The cost substantially prolongs the useful life of the property
D) The cost adapts the property to a new or different use

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under IRC Section 162(a), costs can be deducted as repair expenses when they keep property in an ordinarily efficient operating condition and are incidental in nature. These expenses do not materially add to the property's value or substantially prolong its useful life. Options A, C, and D describe characteristics that would require capitalization under Section 263(a) instead.

## Question 2
According to the tangible property regulations (TPR), what is the fundamental distinction that determines whether a cost should be capitalized or expensed?

A) Whether the cost exceeds the de minimis safe harbor threshold
B) Whether the cost is for incidental repairs versus permanent improvements
C) Whether the property is real or personal property
D) Whether the cost is paid in cash or financed

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The core principle of the tangible property regulations is distinguishing between incidental costs (which can be expensed under Section 162) and permanent improvements (which must be capitalized under Section 263(a)). While the de minimis safe harbor is a helpful tool, it's not the fundamental distinction. The nature of the cost—whether it's incidental maintenance or a permanent betterment—is what drives the capitalization decision.

## Question 3
Which IRC section requires taxpayers to capitalize costs for permanent improvements or betterments to tangible property?

A) IRC Section 162(a)
B) IRC Section 168(k)
C) IRC Section 263(a)
D) IRC Section 179

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: IRC Section 263(a) requires taxpayers to capitalize costs for permanent improvements or betterments that increase value, restore the property, or adapt it to a new use. Section 162(a) allows for deducting repair expenses, while Section 168(k) relates to bonus depreciation and Section 179 covers expensing elections. Under Section 263(a), capitalized costs must be depreciated over the asset's recovery period rather than deducted immediately.

## Question 4
A commercial building owner replaces a damaged HVAC compressor with a similar unit of comparable capacity and efficiency. The unit of property is the entire HVAC system. Under the tangible property regulations, how should this cost likely be treated?

A) Capitalized as a betterment because it replaces a component
B) Expensed as a repair because it maintains ordinary operating condition
C) Capitalized as a restoration because it replaces a major component
D) Expensed under the de minimis safe harbor regardless of cost

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Since the compressor is replaced with a similar unit of comparable capacity and efficiency, and the unit of property is the entire HVAC system, this is considered routine maintenance that keeps the system in ordinarily efficient operating condition. It's not a betterment (no material improvement), and it's not a restoration of the unit of property because only one component is being replaced, not a substantial structural part of the entire HVAC system. This cost would be expensed under Section 162(a).

## Question 5
A restaurant owner spends $45,000 to convert a storage room into a commercial kitchen with new plumbing, electrical, and ventilation systems. Which test under the tangible property regulations would most clearly require capitalization?

A) The betterment test, because it improves the property's efficiency
B) The restoration test, because it rebuilds the space to like-new condition
C) The adaptation test, because it changes the property to a new use
D) The materiality test, because the cost exceeds the safe harbor threshold

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The adaptation test under the tangible property regulations requires capitalization when property is altered to a use that isn't consistent with its intended ordinary use. Converting a storage room into a commercial kitchen clearly changes the property to a new and different use, requiring capitalization under Section 263(a). While the cost might also trigger betterment considerations, the adaptation test most directly applies to this scenario where the fundamental use of the space is changing.

## Question 6
A taxpayer suffers hail damage to their commercial building's roof and receives an insurance settlement. They use the funds to repair the damaged sections and properly claim a casualty loss deduction for the uninsured portion. Later, they spend $150,000 to replace the entire roof structure. How should the roof replacement cost be treated?

A) Expensed as a repair because it's fixing casualty damage
B) Capitalized as a restoration because it's rebuilding after a casualty loss basis adjustment
C) Expensed under the routine maintenance safe harbor
D) Capitalized as a betterment because it improves the building

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the tangible property regulations, the restoration test requires capitalization of amounts paid to repair damage to property after the taxpayer has properly adjusted the basis of the property as a result of a casualty loss. Since the taxpayer claimed a casualty loss deduction (which reduced the property's basis), the subsequent roof replacement must be capitalized as a restoration under Section 263(a), not expensed as a repair.

## Question 7
Under the betterment test, which factor would require capitalization of costs paid for work on a unit of property?

A) The work is performed by a licensed contractor rather than in-house staff
B) The work materially increases the productivity, efficiency, or quality of the property
C) The work is completed within the same tax year it was begun
D) The work costs more than the previous year's maintenance budget

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the betterment test in the tangible property regulations, costs must be capitalized if the work is reasonably expected to materially increase the productivity, efficiency, strength, quality, or output of a unit of property. This is one of the three components of the BAR test (Betterment, Adaptation, Restoration). Whether the work is done by a contractor or in-house staff, the timing of completion, or budget comparisons are not relevant factors in determining betterment.

## Question 8
A cost segregation professional is evaluating whether a building owner's expenditures qualify for immediate deduction or must be capitalized. The owner replaced worn flooring with identical materials, repainted interior walls with the same colors, and upgraded the parking lot lighting system to energy-efficient LED fixtures with motion sensors. How should these costs be analyzed under the tangible property regulations?

A) All three should be expensed as routine maintenance under Section 162(a)
B) Flooring and painting expensed; lighting capitalized as a betterment
C) All three should be capitalized because they improve the building's condition
D) Flooring and painting capitalized; lighting expensed under the energy-efficient safe harbor

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This synthesis question requires applying the capitalization vs. expense rules to multiple scenarios. The flooring replacement with identical materials and repainting with the same colors are both routine maintenance that keeps the property in ordinarily efficient operating condition—these are expensed under Section 162(a). However, upgrading to energy-efficient LED fixtures with motion sensors materially increases the efficiency and functionality of the lighting system, meeting the betterment test under Section 263(a) and requiring capitalization. The key is distinguishing between like-for-like replacements (expense) and improvements that enhance performance (capitalize).

## Question 9
A taxpayer owns a 20-year-old office building and spends $500,000 to replace the entire HVAC system with a new system of similar capacity. However, during the prior tax year, they had properly deducted $80,000 for HVAC repairs that temporarily fixed the failing system. Considering the tangible property regulations and the unit of property concept, how should the $500,000 replacement be analyzed?

A) Expensed as a repair because the new system has similar capacity to the old one
B) Capitalized as a betterment only if the new system is more efficient than the old one
C) Capitalized as a restoration because it replaces a substantial structural part that reached the end of its useful life
D) Partially expensed and partially capitalized based on the ratio of repaired components

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Under the restoration test in the tangible property regulations, costs must be capitalized when replacing a substantial structural part of a unit of property. An HVAC system is a major building system and substantial structural part. Even though the new system has similar capacity, replacing the entire system (especially one that was failing and at the end of its useful life, as evidenced by prior year repairs) constitutes a restoration under Section 263(a). The fact that repairs were needed in the prior year demonstrates the system had reached the end of its useful life, further supporting capitalization as a restoration.

## Question 10
A cost segregation specialist must advise a client on whether costs qualify for immediate deduction. The client asks: "If I spend money fixing something that breaks, isn't that always a repair expense?" Drawing on IRC Sections 162(a) and 263(a) and the BAR framework, what is the most comprehensive and accurate response?

A) "Yes, all costs to fix broken items are repairs under Section 162(a) because they restore ordinary function"
B) "No, you must capitalize all costs over $2,500 under the de minimis safe harbor rules regardless of the nature of the work"
C) "It depends—costs to fix items may require capitalization if the work constitutes a betterment, restoration of the unit of property, or adaptation to a new use under the tangible property regulations"
D) "No, only costs for preventive maintenance can be expensed; any reactive repairs must be capitalized"

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This is the most comprehensive and accurate response because it properly applies the tangible property regulations framework. Simply "fixing" something doesn't automatically qualify for expense treatment under Section 162(a). The cost must be analyzed under the BAR framework: Does it constitute a **B**etterment (materially increasing productivity, efficiency, or quality)? Does it **A**dapt the property to a new use? Does it **R**estore a substantial structural part or rebuild to like-new condition? If any of these tests are met, capitalization under Section 263(a) is required, even if the work "fixes" something broken. This nuanced analysis is critical for cost segregation professionals.
