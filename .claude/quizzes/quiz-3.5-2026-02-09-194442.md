## Question 1
What is the primary function of bonus depreciation under IRC §168(k)?

A) To replace MACRS depreciation entirely for all qualifying property
B) To allow immediate first-year expensing of a percentage of qualifying property cost before regular MACRS depreciation
C) To extend the recovery period for property to reduce annual deductions
D) To apply exclusively to real property with 39-year recovery periods

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Bonus depreciation allows immediate first-year expensing of a percentage (now permanently 100% under OBBBA 2025) of qualifying property's cost, taken before calculating regular MACRS depreciation. The remaining basis after bonus depreciation is then depreciated using standard MACRS over the asset's recovery period. This powerful tax provision front-loads deductions, significantly accelerating cost recovery compared to standard depreciation alone.

## Question 2
Under current law (OBBBA 2025), what is the recovery period threshold for property to generally qualify for bonus depreciation?

A) Property with recovery periods of 10 years or less
B) Property with recovery periods of 20 years or less
C) Property with recovery periods of 27.5 years or less
D) All property regardless of recovery period qualifies

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Bonus depreciation generally applies to property with recovery periods of 20 years or less under IRC §168(k). This includes 5-year property (computers, vehicles, equipment), 7-year property (furniture, fixtures, office equipment), and 15-year property (land improvements, qualified improvement property). Real property with longer recovery periods—such as residential rental property (27.5 years) and commercial buildings (39 years)—does not qualify for bonus depreciation. This 20-year threshold is critical in cost segregation studies, as it determines which reclassified components can receive immediate 100% expensing.

## Question 3
What was the bonus depreciation percentage for property placed in service in 2024 (before the OBBBA changes)?

A) 80%
B) 60%
C) 40%
D) 100%

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) phase-out schedule, property placed in service in 2024 qualified for 60% bonus depreciation. The TCJA had established a declining schedule: 100% (2017-2022), 80% (2023), 60% (2024), 40% (2025), 20% (2026), and 0% (2027 and beyond). However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 permanently restored 100% bonus depreciation for property acquired after January 19, 2025, interrupting this phase-out. Property acquired before the OBBBA effective date continues to follow the original phase-out schedule based on its placed-in-service year.

## Question 4
A commercial building is purchased on February 15, 2025, and a cost segregation study identifies $2 million in 5-year, 7-year, and 15-year property. What bonus depreciation percentage applies to the identified personal property?

A) 0% because commercial buildings don't qualify for bonus depreciation
B) 40% based on the 2025 phase-out schedule
C) 60% carried over from 2024
D) 100% because the property was acquired after January 19, 2025

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: D ✓
**Explanation**: Since the commercial building was acquired on February 15, 2025 (after the January 19, 2025 OBBBA effective date), all personal property components identified through the cost segregation study qualify for the permanent 100% bonus depreciation. While the building structure itself (39-year property) doesn't qualify for bonus depreciation, the $2 million in 5-year, 7-year, and 15-year property components have recovery periods of 20 years or less and therefore receive 100% first-year expensing under the restored bonus depreciation rules. This demonstrates the powerful combination of cost segregation studies with the permanent 100% bonus under OBBBA, providing immediate full deduction for reclassified assets.

## Question 5
A taxpayer acquired a building on December 10, 2024, and completes a cost segregation study in March 2025 that identifies $1.5 million in qualifying 5-year and 7-year property. What bonus depreciation rate applies to the reclassified property?

A) 100% because the cost segregation study was completed after January 19, 2025
B) 60% because the building was acquired in 2024
C) 40% because the study was completed in 2025
D) 0% because cost segregation studies don't qualify for bonus depreciation

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: When a cost segregation study is performed on an existing building, the reclassified property components (5-year and 7-year assets) are treated as having been placed in service on the same date as the building itself, not when the study is completed. Since the building was acquired and placed in service on December 10, 2024, the reclassified property qualifies for the 2024 bonus depreciation rate of 60%. The timing of the cost segregation study completion (March 2025) does not change the placed-in-service date. The catch-up depreciation from prior years is captured through a §481(a) adjustment when filing Form 3115 (Application for Change in Accounting Method), but the applicable bonus rate is locked in based on the original 2024 acquisition date.

## Question 6
Under the OBBBA permanent 100% bonus depreciation rules, which of the following property types would NOT qualify for bonus depreciation?

A) Used office furniture (7-year property) acquired after January 19, 2025
B) New manufacturing equipment (5-year property) acquired after January 19, 2025
C) A commercial office building structure (39-year property) acquired after January 19, 2025
D) Land improvements such as parking lots (15-year property) acquired after January 19, 2025

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The commercial office building structure (39-year non-residential real property) does NOT qualify for bonus depreciation because it has a recovery period exceeding 20 years. Bonus depreciation under IRC §168(k) is limited to property with recovery periods of 20 years or less. The other options all qualify: used office furniture (7-year), new manufacturing equipment (5-year), and land improvements (15-year) all meet the 20-year-or-less threshold. This is why cost segregation studies are so valuable—they identify and reclassify components of the 39-year building structure into shorter recovery period categories (5, 7, 15-year property) that DO qualify for 100% bonus depreciation, significantly accelerating tax deductions.

## Question 7
A business is negotiating to purchase equipment on January 18, 2025 (before OBBBA) versus January 21, 2025 (after OBBBA). The equipment costs $1 million with a 7-year recovery period. Assuming the binding contract date controls bonus depreciation eligibility, what is the difference in first-year tax benefit between these two dates?

A) $0 because both dates are in 2025
B) $400,000 (difference between 60% and 100%)
C) $600,000 (difference between 40% and 100%)
D) $200,000 (difference between 80% and 100%)

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The timing difference of just 3 days creates a massive $600,000 first-year tax benefit difference. A binding contract signed on January 18, 2025 (before the OBBBA cutoff) means the equipment qualifies for only 40% bonus depreciation under the phase-out schedule, providing a $400,000 first-year deduction ($1,000,000 × 40%). A binding contract signed on January 21, 2025 (after January 19) means the equipment qualifies for the permanent 100% bonus depreciation, providing a $1,000,000 first-year deduction ($1,000,000 × 100%). The difference is $600,000 in first-year deductions. This demonstrates why the January 19, 2025 date is critical—the binding contract date (acquisition date) controls eligibility, not the delivery or placed-in-service date. Strategic timing around this cutoff can have enormous tax implications.

## Question 8
A real estate investor is planning acquisitions throughout 2025 and 2026. Buildings acquired before January 19, 2025 qualify for 40% bonus (2025 rate under phase-out), while those acquired after qualify for permanent 100%. How should the investor optimize the timing and cost segregation strategy?

A) Accelerate all acquisitions before January 19, 2025 to lock in the 40% rate
B) Delay acquisitions until after January 19, 2025 to capture permanent 100% bonus, and conduct cost segregation studies immediately upon acquisition
C) Spread acquisitions evenly throughout the period since rates average out over time
D) Focus only on regular MACRS depreciation and ignore bonus depreciation timing

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Delaying acquisitions until after January 19, 2025 maximizes tax benefits by capturing the permanent 100% bonus depreciation rather than the 40% rate available before that date. For each building, a cost segregation study should be conducted immediately upon acquisition to identify 5-year, 7-year, and 15-year property that qualifies for 100% first-year bonus depreciation. This strategy provides substantially greater first-year deductions (100% vs 40% on identified personal property, often 20-40% of building cost) and the permanent nature of the 100% bonus means there's no pressure to rush acquisitions—the investor can pace them according to operational needs and cash flow throughout 2025-2026. This represents optimal tax planning: maximizing deductions while maintaining strategic flexibility. The difference in tax benefit between 40% and 100% bonus on millions in personal property could be substantial.

## Question 9
A tax advisor is consulting with a manufacturing client who purchased one facility on January 10, 2025 (before OBBBA) and another on February 20, 2025 (after OBBBA). Both facilities are undergoing cost segregation studies now. What should the advisor explain about the differential bonus depreciation treatment?

A) Both facilities receive 100% bonus since the studies are being conducted after OBBBA passed
B) The January 10 facility gets 40% bonus and the February 20 facility gets 100% bonus; acquisition dates determine the applicable rate
C) Both facilities receive 40% bonus based on when construction began
D) The facilities should be combined into one study to average the rates

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The two facilities receive different bonus depreciation rates based on their acquisition dates relative to the January 19, 2025 OBBBA cutoff. The January 10 facility qualifies for 40% bonus depreciation on personal property identified through cost segregation (following the 2025 phase-out schedule), while the February 20 facility qualifies for the permanent 100% bonus. The timing of the cost segregation studies (both conducted now) is irrelevant—what matters is when each facility was originally acquired and placed in service. For IRS audit defense, the advisor should emphasize maintaining comprehensive documentation including: (1) purchase agreements showing acquisition dates, (2) binding contract dates and terms, (3) closing documents, (4) placed-in-service dates with supporting evidence, and (5) detailed cost segregation reports clearly showing the placed-in-service dates for identified property. This documentation proves which bonus rate applies to each facility.

## Question 10
Congress is considering future legislation that might modify bonus depreciation. A CFO asks their tax advisor how the "permanent" nature of OBBBA's 100% bonus affects long-term capital planning, given the risk of legislative changes. What is the most sophisticated analysis?

A) The permanent status means Congress cannot change it, so plan with complete certainty
B) While labeled "permanent," Congress can modify any tax provision; however, the lack of sunset provisions removes automatic phase-downs, reducing legislative risk and enabling more confident long-term planning
C) The permanent status is meaningless since all tax law changes annually
D) Companies should assume bonus depreciation will be eliminated by 2027 and plan conservatively

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the most sophisticated and realistic understanding of "permanent" tax provisions. While OBBBA's 100% bonus depreciation is labeled permanent (meaning it has no built-in sunset provisions or phase-down schedule), Congress retains constitutional authority to modify any tax law at any time through future legislation. However, the practical value is substantial: the lack of automatic phase-downs means businesses can plan capital investments without the artificial pressure of declining rates forcing rushed decisions. Unlike the previous regime (where bonus dropped from 100% to 80% to 60% to 40% on a fixed schedule), current law requires affirmative Congressional action to change the rate. This significantly reduces legislative risk and enables more confident long-term capital planning. Smart CFOs should plan based on current law while monitoring legislative developments—a balanced approach that maximizes benefits without ignoring political reality.
