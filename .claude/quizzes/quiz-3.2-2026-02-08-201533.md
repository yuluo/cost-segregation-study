## Question 1
What is a recovery period in the context of MACRS depreciation?

A) The number of months required to recoup an initial investment
B) The number of years over which the cost of an asset is recovered through depreciation deductions
C) The time period during which an asset can be sold without tax penalties
D) The number of years an asset must be held to qualify for capital gains treatment

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: A recovery period is the number of years over which the cost of an asset is recovered through depreciation deductions under MACRS. This fundamental concept determines how quickly taxpayers can claim depreciation deductions for various asset types. Recovery periods are primarily determined by Revenue Procedure 87-56, which provides comprehensive guidance on class lives and recovery periods. For example, computers have a 5-year recovery period, office furniture has a 7-year recovery period, and commercial buildings have a 39-year recovery period.

## Question 2
Which IRS revenue procedure provides comprehensive guidance on class lives and recovery periods for various asset types?

A) Revenue Procedure 2002-28
B) Revenue Procedure 87-56
C) Revenue Procedure 2013-13
D) Revenue Procedure 97-27

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Revenue Procedure 87-56 is the primary IRS guidance document that provides comprehensive information on class lives and recovery periods for various asset types under MACRS. This revenue procedure contains the critical Table B-1 (asset-specific lives) and Table B-2 (industry-specific activities) that cost segregation professionals use to classify property and determine appropriate recovery periods. Revenue Procedure 87-56 has been the foundation for MACRS depreciation classifications since 1987 and remains in effect today with periodic updates for specific provisions.

## Question 3
What is the recovery period for computers and peripheral equipment under MACRS?

A) 3-year property
B) 5-year property
C) 7-year property
D) 10-year property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Computers and peripheral equipment are classified as 5-year property under MACRS. This classification applies to desktop computers, laptops, servers, printers, monitors, keyboards, and other computer peripherals. The 5-year recovery period allows for relatively rapid cost recovery, making these assets attractive candidates for accelerated depreciation. Under current law (post-OBBBA 2025), qualifying 5-year property placed in service after January 19, 2025, is also eligible for 100% bonus depreciation, potentially allowing immediate full expensing in the year placed in service.

## Question 4
A business purchases new office furniture (desks, chairs, filing cabinets) for $100,000. What recovery period should be used for MACRS depreciation?

A) 5-year property
B) 7-year property
C) 10-year property
D) 15-year property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Office furniture, fixtures, and equipment are classified as 7-year property under MACRS. This includes desks, chairs, filing cabinets, bookcases, conference tables, and other office furnishings. The 7-year recovery period is one of the most common classifications in cost segregation studies, as many movable fixtures and equipment fall into this category. Like 5-year property, 7-year assets with a recovery period of 20 years or less qualify for 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 for property acquired after January 19, 2025, allowing businesses to potentially expense the full $100,000 in the first year.

## Question 5
A commercial property owner installs new parking lots, sidewalks, and landscaping around their building. What is the correct recovery period for these land improvements?

A) 5-year property
B) 7-year property
C) 15-year property
D) 39-year property (same as the building)

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Land improvements such as parking lots, sidewalks, and landscaping are classified as 15-year property under MACRS. This is a critical classification in cost segregation studies because these improvements are often initially capitalized as part of the building's 39-year basis but can be reclassified to the much shorter 15-year recovery period. This 15-year classification provides substantial tax benefits compared to the 39-year building recovery period. Additionally, since 15-year property has a recovery period of 20 years or less, it qualifies for 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025, making proper identification of land improvements extremely valuable in cost segregation analysis.

## Question 6
An investor purchases a residential apartment building to rent to tenants. What is the MACRS recovery period for residential rental property?

A) 15 years
B) 27.5 years
C) 31.5 years
D) 39 years

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Residential rental property is depreciated over 27.5 years under MACRS. This classification applies to apartment buildings, duplexes, and other properties where 80% or more of the gross rental income is from dwelling units. The 27.5-year recovery period is shorter than the 39-year period for commercial buildings, providing faster cost recovery for residential landlords. However, it's important to note that while the building structure itself uses this 27.5-year recovery period, a cost segregation study can identify components within the residential property (such as appliances, carpeting, land improvements) that qualify for much shorter recovery periods of 5, 7, or 15 years, significantly accelerating depreciation deductions.

## Question 7
A developer constructs a new office building (non-residential real property). What is the standard MACRS recovery period for commercial buildings?

A) 27.5 years
B) 31.5 years
C) 39 years
D) 40 years

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Non-residential real property, which includes commercial buildings such as office buildings, retail stores, warehouses, and manufacturing facilities, has a 39-year recovery period under MACRS. This is the longest standard recovery period and applies to the building structure itself. The 39-year classification makes cost segregation studies particularly valuable for commercial property owners, as the studies identify components that can be reclassified from this slow 39-year recovery to much faster 5-year, 7-year, or 15-year recovery periods. This substantial acceleration of depreciation deductions is why cost segregation has become a standard tax planning tool for commercial real estate investors.

## Question 8
Revenue Procedure 87-56 provides two key classification tables: Table B-1 and Table B-2. How do these tables differ, and which takes priority when both could apply to an asset?

A) Table B-1 is for new property and Table B-2 is for used property; Table B-1 takes priority
B) Table B-1 provides asset-specific lives while Table B-2 provides industry-specific activities; Table B-2 generally takes priority when applicable
C) Table B-1 is for personal property and Table B-2 is for real property; Table B-1 takes priority
D) Both tables are identical and either can be used interchangeably

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is a critical distinction in cost segregation analysis. Table B-1 provides asset-specific lives for particular types of property (such as office furniture, computers, or specific machinery), while Table B-2 provides class lives based on the business activity or industry in which the asset is used (such as manufacturing, retail, or hospitality). When an asset could be classified under both tables, Table B-2 generally takes priority because the industry-specific classification in Table B-2 is considered more specific to the actual use of the asset. For example, restaurant equipment might have a general classification in Table B-1, but if the restaurant operates within a specific industry described in Table B-2, that industry-specific classification would govern. This hierarchy is essential for proper asset classification in cost segregation studies.

## Question 9
A cost segregation consultant is analyzing a mixed-use property that includes both commercial office space (39-year) and residential apartments (27.5-year) in the same building. How should the consultant approach the recovery period determination, and what impact does this have on the cost segregation strategy?

A) Use 39-year recovery for the entire building since commercial space is present
B) Use 27.5-year recovery for the entire building since residential space is present
C) Allocate building costs proportionally based on square footage, applying 27.5-year to residential portions and 39-year to commercial portions; conduct separate cost segregation analyses for each use type
D) Average the two recovery periods to 33.25 years for the entire property

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This is the sophisticated and compliant approach for mixed-use properties. When a building contains both residential rental space (27.5-year property) and commercial space (39-year property), the costs must be allocated proportionally—typically based on square footage, gross rental income, or another reasonable method. Each portion is then depreciated using its appropriate recovery period. Critically, the cost segregation analysis should also be conducted separately for each use type, as the identified personal property and land improvements in the residential portion would be allocated to the 27.5-year basis while those in the commercial portion would be allocated to the 39-year basis. This proportional allocation approach ensures accurate tax reporting and maximizes the benefit of accelerated depreciation for both portions of the property. Proper documentation of the allocation methodology is essential for IRS audit defense.

## Question 10
Following the OBBBA 2025 legislation, a real estate investor is evaluating whether to conduct a cost segregation study on a commercial building acquired on March 1, 2025. The building cost $5 million, and preliminary estimates suggest the study could identify $1.5 million in 5-year, 7-year, and 15-year property. How do the recovery period classifications interact with the permanent 100% bonus depreciation to maximize the investor's first-year tax benefit?

A) Only 5-year and 7-year property qualify for bonus depreciation, so only those categories should be segregated
B) All property with recovery periods of 20 years or less (5-year, 7-year, and 15-year) qualifies for 100% bonus depreciation, allowing immediate expensing of the full $1.5 million identified
C) Bonus depreciation is capped at $1 million, so the cost segregation study provides limited additional benefit
D) The 39-year building structure should be converted to 15-year property to maximize bonus depreciation benefits

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is exactly how the permanent 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 revolutionizes cost segregation analysis. Property acquired after January 19, 2025, with recovery periods of 20 years or less qualifies for 100% bonus depreciation. Since the building was acquired on March 1, 2025, all identified components—whether 5-year computers and appliances, 7-year furniture and fixtures, or 15-year land improvements and QIP—qualify for immediate 100% expensing. The investor can immediately deduct the full $1.5 million in the first year, rather than depreciating it over 5, 7, or 15 years. The remaining $3.5 million building structure continues on the 39-year recovery schedule. This combination makes cost segregation studies extraordinarily valuable post-OBBBA, as every dollar reclassified from 39-year to qualifying shorter-life property generates an immediate first-year tax deduction.
