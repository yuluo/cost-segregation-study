A) 27.5 years
B) 31.5 years
C) 39 years

## Question 3
Which of the following is classified as a land improvement (15-year property) in a cost segregation study?

A) Built-in cabinetry
B) Interior carpet and padding
C) Parking lot paving and striping
D) Decorative light fixtures

**Your Answer**: C

## Question 4
A property owner recently purchased a restaurant building. During the cost segregation study, the engineer identifies the commercial kitchen exhaust hood system, which is bolted to the wall and ducted through the roof. How should this asset most likely be classified?

A) Real property (39-year) because it is permanently attached to the building structure
B) Personal property (5- or 7-year) because it serves the specific business activity rather than the building's general operation
C) Land improvement (15-year) because it vents to the exterior
D) Non-depreciable property because it is part of the building shell

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Even though the exhaust hood is physically attached to the building, the key classification test is whether the asset serves the building's general operation and maintenance or the specific business activity conducted within it.

## Question 5
An engineer performing a cost segregation study on a newly constructed office building identifies the following components. Which combination correctly pairs items with their proper asset classifications?

A) Elevator (39-year real property) and parking lot lighting (15-year land improvement)
B) HVAC system (5-year personal property) and roof structure (15-year land improvement)
C) Sidewalks (39-year real property) and electrical wiring (5-year personal property)
D) Landscaping (39-year real property) and structural steel (15-year land improvement)

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: Elevators are integral to the building's operation and are classified as 39-year real property. Parking lot lighting is an exterior site improvement classified as a 15-year land improvement.

## Question 6
A cost segregation professional is analyzing a retail strip mall. The owner recently installed decorative tile flooring in the common areas and vinyl plank flooring in individual tenant spaces. How should these flooring types most likely be classified?

A) Both are 39-year real property since flooring is permanently installed
B) Both are 5-year personal property since all flooring is removable
C) Decorative tile in common areas is 39-year real property; vinyl plank in tenant spaces is 5- or 7-year personal property
D) Decorative tile in common areas is 5-year personal property; vinyl plank in tenant spaces is 39-year real property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The classification depends on context and purpose. Decorative tile in common areas serves the building's general appearance and is typically classified as real property (39-year). Flooring in individual tenant spaces, especially removable types like vinyl plank, can be classified as personal property with a shorter recovery period.

## Question 7
A client asks why their newly purchased warehouse has fewer reclassifiable assets in the cost segregation study compared to a hotel they previously purchased at a similar price. What is the most accurate explanation?

A) Warehouses are exempt from cost segregation studies under IRS guidelines
B) Hotels contain significantly more specialized personal property components (decorative finishes, furniture, specialized plumbing/electrical) than a basic warehouse
C) The warehouse recovery period is already 15 years, so there is less benefit to reclassification
D) Cost segregation studies only apply to residential properties, so the warehouse results are limited

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Property type significantly affects cost segregation results. Hotels, restaurants, and retail properties tend to have a high percentage of reclassifiable assets due to extensive finish-out, specialized systems, and decorative elements.

## Question 8
A cost segregation engineer encounters a building component that is physically attached to the structure, serves both the building's general HVAC system and a specialized manufacturing process, and would cause significant damage to the building if removed. Which of the following best describes the classification challenge and likely outcome?

A) It must be classified entirely as personal property because it serves a business function
B) It must be classified entirely as real property because removal would damage the building
C) The engineer should allocate the cost between personal property and real property based on the proportion of use dedicated to each function
D) The component should be excluded from the study entirely due to its dual nature

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: When a component serves dual purposes, the cost can be allocated proportionally. The portion serving the specialized manufacturing process may qualify as personal property, while the portion serving the building's general HVAC qualifies as real property.

## Question 9
A taxpayer placed a commercial property in service in 2023 and is now considering a cost segregation study in 2026. The study identifies $500,000 in assets that should have been classified as 5-year personal property but were originally depreciated as 39-year real property. What is the most appropriate tax mechanism to capture the missed depreciation?

A) File amended returns for all prior years to correct the depreciation schedules
B) File a Form 3115 (Change in Accounting Method) to claim a Section 481(a) catch-up adjustment in the current year
C) Simply begin depreciating the reclassified assets over 5 years going forward, ignoring prior years
D) The taxpayer has forfeited the benefit since the study was not performed in the year the property was placed in service

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: The IRS requires a change in accounting method via Form 3115 to correct depreciation classifications. The Section 481(a) adjustment allows the taxpayer to capture all previously missed depreciation in a single current-year catch-up adjustment.

## Question 10
A cost segregation team is classifying assets for a multi-use facility that contains a medical office (39-year), an attached parking garage (39-year real property), and surrounding site work. The facility has a single electrical system that powers all three areas, with sub-panels dedicated to each. How should the electrical system costs be handled for classification purposes?

A) The entire electrical system is 39-year real property because it is integral to the building
B) The main electrical service is 39-year real property, but dedicated sub-panels and branch wiring serving specific medical equipment should be analyzed separately as potential personal property
C) All electrical components are 15-year land improvements because they connect to the utility grid outside
D) Electrical systems are excluded from cost segregation studies per IRS audit guidelines

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The main electrical service serves the building generally and is real property. However, dedicated circuits and sub-panels serving specific equipment can be classified as personal property because they serve the business activity, not the building.
