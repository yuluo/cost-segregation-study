## Question 1
Which of the following best defines "functional interdependence" in the context of determining a Unit of Property?

A) Components that are physically attached to each other
B) Components where placing one in service is dependent on placing the other in service
C) Components that share the same depreciation recovery period
D) Components that were purchased from the same vendor

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Functional interdependence means that the placing in service of one component is dependent on the placing in service of another component. This is the foundational test for determining whether components should be treated as a single Unit of Property. For example, in an elevator system, the motor, cables, car, and control system are functionally interdependent because none can function without the others - they must all be placed in service together for the elevator to operate.

## Question 2
Which of the following is NOT one of the nine specifically enumerated building systems under the tangible property regulations?

A) Gas distribution system
B) Fire protection and alarm systems
C) Roofing system
D) Security systems

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The roofing system is NOT one of the nine specifically enumerated building systems. The roof is part of the building structure (envelope), not a separate building system. The nine enumerated systems are: (1) HVAC, (2) Plumbing, (3) Electrical, (4) Escalators, (5) Elevators, (6) Fire protection and alarm systems, (7) Security systems, (8) Gas distribution system, and (9) Other systems identified in regulations. Gas distribution system (Answer A) IS one of the nine enumerated systems. Understanding this distinction is critical because the building structure and each of the nine systems are analyzed separately for repair versus improvement determinations.

## Question 3
In the context of Unit of Property, what does it mean when the regulations state that "a building is generally a single UOP"?

A) All components within the building must be depreciated together over 39 years
B) The building structure (envelope and frame) is one UOP, but the nine building systems are each separate UOPs
C) Only the foundation and walls constitute the building UOP
D) The building and all its systems must be treated as one inseparable unit for all tax purposes

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is a critical concept - when the regulations state "a building is generally a single UOP," they mean the building structure (envelope and frame) is treated as one Unit of Property. However, capitalization rules are applied at two distinct levels: (1) the building structure UOP, and (2) each of the nine specifically enumerated building systems as separate UOPs. This two-level framework allows for independent analysis of work on the building structure versus work on individual building systems. For example, replacing exterior walls affects the building structure UOP, while replacing an HVAC compressor affects only the HVAC system UOP - these are analyzed separately under the repair versus improvement rules.

## Question 4
Which of the following systems are included in the nine enumerated building systems? (Select the complete list)

A) HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Roofing, Windows, Flooring
B) HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Escalators, Elevators, Fire protection, Security, Gas distribution, Other identified systems
C) Only mechanical systems: HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Gas distribution
D) HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Structural, Foundation, Roofing, Fire protection, Security, Elevators

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: The complete list of the nine enumerated building systems is: (1) HVAC, (2) Plumbing, (3) Electrical, (4) Escalators, (5) Elevators, (6) Fire protection and alarm systems, (7) Security systems, (8) Gas distribution system, and (9) Other systems identified in regulations. Answer D incorrectly includes Structural, Foundation, and Roofing - these are NOT separate building systems; they are part of the building structure UOP itself. Answer D also omits Escalators and Gas distribution system, which ARE enumerated systems. This is a key distinction: the building structure (including foundation, walls, roof, floors) is ONE UOP, while each of the nine enumerated systems is a SEPARATE UOP.

## Question 5
A building has two separate plumbing systems: one serving the restrooms and kitchen, and another serving the manufacturing process equipment. How should these be treated under the UOP framework?

A) Combined as a single plumbing system UOP since they're in the same building
B) Each plumbing system is a separate UOP because they serve different functional areas
C) The restroom/kitchen plumbing is part of the building structure; only the process plumbing is a separate UOP
D) Both systems must be combined with all other building systems as one UOP

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: When a building has multiple systems of the same type serving different functional areas, each system is treated as a separate Unit of Property. Just like in the previous quiz where multiple HVAC systems serving different zones were each separate UOPs, here the two plumbing systems are separate UOPs. The restroom/kitchen plumbing system is NOT part of the building structure - plumbing is one of the nine enumerated building systems, which are always separate from the building structure UOP. The process plumbing serving manufacturing equipment is also its own separate UOP. This distinction is important because work on one plumbing system would be analyzed independently from work on the other system, and separately from any work on the building structure.

## Question 6
An office building undergoes a renovation where contractors replace all the ductwork but keep the existing HVAC chillers, air handlers, and thermostats. Under the tangible property regulations, which statement is correct regarding the Unit of Property analysis?

A) The ductwork is a separate UOP, so replacing it requires automatic capitalization
B) The entire HVAC system is the UOP; replacing only the ductwork is a partial replacement that must be analyzed under the BAR tests
C) Since ductwork is part of the building structure, this is analyzed as work on the building UOP
D) Only the replaced ductwork components need to be capitalized; the rest can be ignored

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The entire HVAC system (including chillers, air handlers, thermostats, ductwork, etc.) constitutes a single Unit of Property based on functional interdependence - all these components work together and cannot operate independently. Since only the ductwork is being replaced while the chillers, air handlers, and thermostats remain, this is a partial replacement of the HVAC system UOP, not a complete replacement. Therefore, it's not automatically capitalized. Instead, the expenditure must be evaluated under the BAR tests (Betterment, Adaptation, Restoration) to determine whether it improves the HVAC system (requiring capitalization) or merely repairs it (allowing immediate deduction). This demonstrates how the UOP framework prevents automatic capitalization of component replacements.

## Question 7
A warehouse has a sprinkler system for fire protection. The building owner replaces 30% of the sprinkler heads and piping after a code inspection revealed corrosion. How does the Unit of Property concept affect whether this must be capitalized?

A) Each sprinkler head is a separate UOP, so replacing 30% means capitalizing only those specific heads
B) The fire protection and alarm system is the UOP; replacing 30% of components triggers the BAR test analysis rather than automatic capitalization
C) Building safety systems must always be capitalized regardless of the UOP framework
D) Since it's less than 50% replacement, it automatically qualifies as a deductible repair

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The fire protection and alarm system is one of the nine specifically enumerated building systems, and the entire system (sprinkler heads, piping, control panels, alarms, smoke detectors, etc.) constitutes a single Unit of Property based on functional interdependence. Since only 30% of the sprinkler heads and piping are being replaced while the rest of the fire protection system remains intact, this is a partial replacement of the UOP - not a complete replacement. The UOP framework means this expenditure is NOT automatically capitalized. Instead, it must be evaluated under the BAR tests (Betterment, Adaptation, Restoration) to determine if the work improves the fire protection system (capitalization required) or merely repairs it (deductible). The code compliance aspect might trigger the Adaptation test if the work adapts the system to a new use.

## Question 8
A retail building has three separate electrical systems: (1) general building lighting and outlets, (2) dedicated power for refrigeration equipment, and (3) backup generator system. A cost segregation professional is analyzing recent electrical work. How should the professional apply the UOP concept to these three systems?

A) All three are combined into one electrical system UOP because they share the same main service panel
B) Each of the three electrical systems is a separate UOP, and work on each must be analyzed independently
C) Only the general building electrical is a UOP; the equipment-specific systems are personal property outside the UOP framework
D) The professional should combine all three with the building structure UOP to simplify the analysis

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: When a building has multiple electrical systems serving different functional areas or purposes, each system is treated as a separate Unit of Property. Following the same principle we've seen with multiple HVAC systems and plumbing systems, the three electrical systems here are each separate UOPs: (1) the general building electrical system, (2) the refrigeration equipment electrical system, and (3) the backup generator system. Work on each system must be analyzed independently under the UOP framework and BAR tests. While Answer C raises an interesting point about equipment-specific systems potentially qualifying as personal property for cost segregation purposes, that's a separate classification issue - for UOP and repair versus improvement analysis, each system is still a separate UOP regardless of whether it's ultimately classified as real or personal property. Each system's functional interdependence creates a distinct boundary for analysis.

## Question 9
Consider a hospital building where work is performed on multiple systems simultaneously: new electrical panels, HVAC duct replacement, and plumbing fixture upgrades. A taxpayer wants to apply the de minimis safe harbor to expense the entire project. How does the Unit of Property framework impact this strategy?

A) The UOP concept is irrelevant when using safe harbors; the entire project can be expensed if under the threshold
B) Each of the three building systems is a separate UOP, so the de minimis safe harbor must be applied separately to the costs attributable to each system's UOP, not to the combined project cost
C) Only the building structure UOP matters for safe harbor purposes
D) Safe harbors override the UOP framework, allowing the taxpayer to choose any UOP definition

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This synthesis question demonstrates that the Unit of Property framework is foundational to all tangible property regulations, including safe harbors. The electrical system, HVAC system, and plumbing system are three separate UOPs under the nine enumerated building systems. Safe harbors, including the de minimis safe harbor, must be applied separately to each UOP - you cannot combine costs across different UOPs to meet safe harbor thresholds. For example, if the electrical panel costs $2,000, HVAC duct replacement costs $3,000, and plumbing fixture upgrades cost $1,500, each amount is evaluated separately against the de minimis threshold for its respective UOP. The UOP framework establishes the boundaries for ALL subsequent analysis, including safe harbors, BAR tests, and capitalization determinations. This prevents taxpayers from manipulating results by aggregating or disaggregating costs inappropriately.

## Question 10
A commercial property owner is planning significant work on their building and wants to structure the contracts to maximize current-year deductions while remaining compliant with tangible property regulations. Their cost segregation advisor recommends structuring work orders to align with the Unit of Property framework. Which approach best demonstrates proper application of the UOP concept?

A) Create a single master contract covering all building work to simplify accounting and claim the entire amount as a repair
B) Separate contracts by building system UOP (one for HVAC work, one for electrical, one for plumbing, etc.) and separately evaluate each under the BAR tests to identify legitimate repair deductions
C) Split large projects into multiple small invoices to stay under safe harbor thresholds
D) Document all work as "maintenance and repairs" regardless of actual scope to avoid capitalization

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This synthesis question tests understanding of how to properly apply the UOP framework in real-world cost segregation planning. Answer B demonstrates the correct, compliant approach: structure work orders and contracts to align with the Unit of Property boundaries (each of the nine enumerated building systems), then separately evaluate the work on each UOP under the BAR tests (Betterment, Adaptation, Restoration). This approach respects the regulatory framework while maximizing legitimate tax benefits - repairs to individual systems can be deducted immediately, while improvements must be capitalized (but can then benefit from cost segregation to identify shorter recovery periods). Answer A (combining all work) ignores UOP boundaries, Answer C (splitting invoices) is improper manipulation of safe harbors, and Answer D (mislabeling work) is fraudulent. Proper UOP application means honest analysis within the correct framework, not manipulation of documentation.
