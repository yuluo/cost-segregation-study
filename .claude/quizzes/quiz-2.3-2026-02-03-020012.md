## Question 1
What are the two fundamental property categories that every cost segregation study must distinguish between according to the Internal Revenue Code?

A) Tangible and intangible property
B) Section 1245 and Section 1250 property
C) Real and personal property
D) Capital and expense property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: According to the IRC, cost segregation studies must categorize all property into Section 1245 property (tangible personal property and certain special-purpose property) and Section 1250 property (real property including building structures and structural components). This fundamental distinction drives the entire depreciation schedule.

## Question 2
What is the typical depreciation period for Section 1245 property?

A) 27.5 or 39 years
B) 15 years
C) 5 or 7 years
D) 10 years

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Section 1245 property has significantly shorter depreciation lives, typically 5 or 7 years, compared to Section 1250 real property. This shorter recovery period is one of the key benefits of cost segregation, as it allows for accelerated depreciation on qualifying assets like machinery, equipment, furniture, and fixtures.

## Question 3
Which of the following is NOT considered Section 1250 property?

A) Building foundation and walls
B) Roof structure
C) Furniture and fixtures
D) Basic HVAC systems

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Furniture and fixtures are classified as Section 1245 property (tangible personal property), not Section 1250 property. Section 1250 property includes the building structure and its structural components such as foundations, walls, roof structure, and basic HVAC systems. Understanding this distinction is critical for proper asset classification in cost segregation studies.

## Question 4
A manufacturing facility is conducting a cost segregation study. They have a specialized HVAC system that was installed specifically to maintain precise temperature and humidity for production equipment. How should this system be classified?

A) Always Section 1250 as part of the building's HVAC
B) Section 1245 as special-purpose property supporting production
C) 15-year land improvement property
D) It cannot be depreciated separately from the building

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: While basic HVAC systems are typically classified as Section 1250 property, the study material specifically notes "HVAC systems (unless special-purpose)." When HVAC equipment is installed specifically to support manufacturing operations or production facilities (such as maintaining precise environmental conditions for production equipment), it qualifies as Section 1245 property. This is an example of "other tangible property used as integral part of production facilities."

## Question 5
A property owner misclassifies $500,000 of Section 1245 property as Section 1250 property in their cost segregation study. What is the most likely consequence?

A) No impact since both are depreciable
B) The IRS will automatically correct it without penalty
C) Slower depreciation and potential audit adjustments
D) Immediate disqualification of the entire study

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The study material explicitly states that "proper classification directly impacts depreciation schedule" and "misclassification can result in audit adjustments." If Section 1245 property (5-7 year life) is incorrectly classified as Section 1250 property (27.5-39 year life), the taxpayer loses the benefit of accelerated depreciation and depreciates the asset much more slowly. During an IRS audit, this misclassification could be identified and require costly adjustments.

## Question 6
You're reviewing a cost segregation study for a restaurant property. Which of the following would you classify as Section 1245 property?

A) The building's exterior walls
B) Walk-in coolers and kitchen equipment
C) The concrete foundation
D) The main structural roof trusses

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Walk-in coolers and kitchen equipment are tangible personal property classified as Section 1245 property, qualifying for shorter depreciation periods (typically 5 or 7 years). In contrast, exterior walls, the foundation, and roof trusses are all structural components of the building classified as Section 1250 property with 39-year depreciation. Restaurant equipment is a common example where cost segregation provides significant tax benefits.

## Question 7
An office building undergoes a cost segregation study. The study identifies specialized electrical wiring installed solely to support computer server equipment. The building also has standard electrical systems serving general lighting and outlets. How should these be classified?

A) Both are Section 1250 as part of the building's electrical system
B) Server wiring is Section 1245; general electrical is Section 1250
C) Both are Section 1245 since they're electrical systems
D) Both are 15-year property as electrical improvements

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is a classic example of distinguishing between general-purpose and special-purpose systems. The study material notes that Section 1250 includes "basic plumbing and electrical systems" (structural components), while Section 1245 includes property serving specific equipment. Specialized electrical wiring installed solely for server equipment qualifies as Section 1245 property because it serves a specific function, while the general building electrical system remains Section 1250 property.

## Question 8
A developer is completing a cost segregation study on a new apartment complex. The property includes decorative fencing around the perimeter, a concrete foundation, lobby furniture, and a central boiler system. Which combination correctly identifies items that would typically have different depreciation periods?

A) Fencing (15-year), Foundation (39-year), Furniture (7-year), Boiler (39-year)
B) All items depreciate over 27.5 years as residential rental property
C) Fencing (39-year), Foundation (27.5-year), Furniture (15-year), Boiler (27.5-year)
D) All items qualify for 5-year depreciation under cost segregation

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B or C (for residential rental property, structural components should be 27.5-year) ✗
**Explanation**: For residential rental property (apartment complex), the correct depreciation periods are: Fencing (15-year land improvement), Foundation (27.5-year residential structure), Furniture (7-year personal property), and Central boiler (27.5-year residential building system). Answer A incorrectly lists Foundation and Boiler as 39-year, which would apply to non-residential property, not residential rental property.

## Question 9
During a cost segregation study, you encounter a dispute about classifying a specialized electrical distribution panel that exclusively serves manufacturing equipment. The CFO argues it should be Section 1250 because "all electrical systems are part of the building." What is the most appropriate professional response?

A) Agree to avoid conflict and classify as Section 1250
B) Explain that special-purpose systems serving production equipment qualify as Section 1245
C) Compromise and use 15-year land improvement classification
D) Refuse to complete the study due to client interference

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This scenario tests professional ethics and technical knowledge. The study material clearly states that Section 1245 includes "other tangible property used as integral part of manufacturing operations" and that "professional judgment required for boundary cases." While basic electrical systems are Section 1250 property, specialized electrical serving specific production equipment qualifies as Section 1245. A professional must educate the client on proper classification rather than compromise technical accuracy to avoid conflict.

## Question 10
A cost segregation professional is reviewing a study where the preparer classified ALL building components as either "definitely Section 1245" or "definitely Section 1250" with no items requiring judgment calls. What does this suggest about the study's quality?

A) Excellent - it shows clear, confident decision-making
B) Concerning - real studies typically involve boundary cases requiring professional judgment
C) Acceptable if the building is simple construction
D) Superior - eliminating gray areas reduces audit risk

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The study material explicitly states that "professional judgment required for boundary cases." In real-world cost segregation studies, there are almost always gray areas where components don't fit neatly into one category - such as specialized systems, dual-purpose equipment, or hybrid installations. A study with no judgment calls suggests the preparer may be oversimplifying the analysis or lacking the expertise to identify nuanced classification issues. Quality studies acknowledge and document these judgment calls.
