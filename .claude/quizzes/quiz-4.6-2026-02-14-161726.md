## Question 1
The routine maintenance safe harbor for buildings allows expensing of activities performed more than once in how many years?

A) 5 years
B) 7 years
C) 10 years
D) 15 years

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The routine maintenance safe harbor for **buildings** specifically allows expensing of activities that the taxpayer reasonably expects to perform more than once in **10 years**. This is a key threshold to remember. For non-building property, the test is whether the activity is performed more than once during the asset's class life. The 10-year rule is building-specific and is one of the most commonly tested aspects of this safe harbor.

## Question 2
What is the de minimis safe harbor threshold for taxpayers WITHOUT an Applicable Financial Statement (AFS)?

A) $1,000 per invoice line item
B) $2,500 per invoice line item
C) $5,000 per invoice line item
D) $10,000 per invoice line item

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: For taxpayers **without** an Applicable Financial Statement (AFS), the de minimis safe harbor threshold is **$2,500** per invoice line item. Taxpayers **with** an AFS can expense up to **$5,000** per invoice line item. This is a critical distinction to remember. Don't confuse these thresholds with the $10,000 threshold from the safe harbor for small taxpayers, which is a completely different safe harbor with different eligibility requirements.

## Question 3
What is the de minimis safe harbor threshold for taxpayers WITH an Applicable Financial Statement (AFS)?

A) $2,500 per invoice line item
B) $5,000 per invoice line item
C) $7,500 per invoice line item
D) $10,000 per invoice line item

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: For taxpayers **with** an Applicable Financial Statement (AFS), the de minimis safe harbor threshold is **$5,000** per invoice line item. An AFS includes: (1) a financial statement filed with the SEC, (2) a certified audited financial statement with an independent CPA report, or (3) a financial statement required to be submitted to a federal or state government agency (excluding SEC or IRS). Remember the comparison: **no AFS = $2,500**, **with AFS = $5,000**.

## Question 4
The safe harbor for small taxpayers allows expensing of repair costs up to the lesser of $10,000 or what percentage of the building's unadjusted basis?

A) 1%
B) 2%
C) 5%
D) 10%

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The safe harbor for small taxpayers allows expensing when total annual repair and improvement costs do not exceed the lesser of **$10,000** or **2% of the building's unadjusted basis**. For example, if a building has an unadjusted basis of $600,000, then 2% = $12,000, so the threshold would be $10,000 (the lesser amount). If the building has a basis of $400,000, then 2% = $8,000, so the threshold would be $8,000 (the lesser amount). This "lesser of" calculation is crucial for determining eligibility.

## Question 5
When must the written accounting policy for the de minimis safe harbor be in place?

A) By the tax filing deadline
B) At the beginning of the tax year
C) Before the first qualifying purchase
D) Anytime during the tax year

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: A critical requirement for the de minimis safe harbor is that the written accounting policy **must be in place at the beginning of the tax year**. You cannot adopt it mid-year, before a specific purchase, or retroactively when filing your return. This advance planning requirement is mandatory and distinguishes the de minimis safe harbor from some other tax elections. It prevents taxpayers from waiting until year-end to see what they spent and then retroactively adopting a policy to expense those items.

## Question 6
A building owner with gross receipts of $8 million and a building with unadjusted basis of $700,000 spent $12,000 on repairs. Under the safe harbor for small taxpayers, how much can they expense?

A) $12,000 - the full amount
B) $10,000 - the lesser of $10,000 or 2% of basis
C) $14,000 - 2% of the building's basis
D) $0 - they don't qualify because costs exceed the threshold

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: D ✓
**Explanation**: This is a critical point about the safe harbor for small taxpayers - it's an **all-or-nothing election**. Let's check the qualifications:
- ✓ Gross receipts: $8 million (under $10 million limit)
- ✓ Building basis: $700,000 (under $1 million limit)
- ✗ Costs: $12,000 exceed the threshold

The threshold is the lesser of $10,000 or 2% of $700,000 (which is $14,000), so the threshold is **$10,000**. Since the actual repair costs of $12,000 **exceed** this $10,000 threshold, they **do not qualify** for the safe harbor at all and cannot expense **any amount** under this provision. You cannot partially apply this safe harbor up to the threshold - if costs exceed the limit, the entire amount must be analyzed under normal capitalization rules (BAR tests, etc.).

## Question 7
A taxpayer replaces carpet in a building every 8 years. The building has a 39-year class life. Which statement is TRUE about the routine maintenance safe harbor?

A) It qualifies because it's performed more than once in 10 years
B) It qualifies because it's performed more than once during the class life
C) Both A and B are true - either test qualifies the activity
D) It doesn't qualify because carpets are always capitalized

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The routine maintenance safe harbor for buildings has **two alternative tests** - you only need to meet **ONE** of them (it's an "OR" test):

1. Performed more than once during the asset's class life, **OR**
2. Performed more than once in 10 years (for buildings)

For carpet replaced every 8 years in a building with a 39-year class life:
- **Test 1 (class life)**: 39 years ÷ 8 years = 4.875 times → **QUALIFIES** ✓
- **Test 2 (10-year rule)**: Every 8 years is more than once in 10 years → **QUALIFIES** ✓

In this case, **both statements A and B are true**. The carpet replacement qualifies under **both** tests. While either test alone would be sufficient, answer C is the most complete because it recognizes that both tests are satisfied. This demonstrates understanding of the "OR" nature of the routine maintenance safe harbor - you only need one test, but can satisfy both.

## Question 8
A landlord with $7 million in gross receipts owns a building with a $950,000 unadjusted basis. They spent $9,000 on qualifying repairs this year. Next year, they expect $18,000 in repairs. How should they approach the safe harbor for small taxpayers?

A) Elect the safe harbor both years since they meet the size qualifications
B) Elect in year 1 only, analyze year 2 costs under BAR tests or other safe harbors
C) Don't elect either year to maintain consistency
D) Elect in year 2 only since the amount is larger

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The safe harbor for small taxpayers is an **annual election** that must be evaluated each year based on that year's actual costs. Let's analyze both years:

**Year 1:**
- Gross receipts: $7M ✓, Building basis: $950K ✓
- Costs: $9,000
- Threshold: Lesser of $10,000 or 2% × $950,000 = $19,000, so threshold is **$10,000**
- $9,000 < $10,000 ✓ **QUALIFIES - should elect**

**Year 2:**
- Gross receipts: $7M ✓, Building basis: $950K ✓
- Costs: $18,000
- Threshold: $10,000 (same calculation)
- $18,000 > $10,000 ✗ **Does NOT qualify**

Even though the building size and gross receipts qualify both years, the client can only use the safe harbor in Year 1 because Year 2's costs ($18,000) exceed the $10,000 threshold. In Year 2, they would need to analyze individual expenses under the BAR tests or other safe harbors (like routine maintenance for recurring items, or de minimis for small items). This is the **annual election** concept - you must evaluate eligibility every year.

## Question 9
A property owner has $13,000 in annual repairs: $6,000 HVAC maintenance (done every 5 years), $4,000 painting (done every 7 years), $2,000 supplies at $200 each, and $1,000 one-time roof patch. Building basis is $800,000, gross receipts are $9 million. What is the optimal tax treatment strategy?

A) Use small taxpayer safe harbor for everything since they qualify
B) Capitalize everything because total exceeds $10,000
C) Use routine maintenance for HVAC and painting, de minimis for supplies, analyze roof patch separately
D) Use de minimis safe harbor for all items since each category is under $5,000

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This demonstrates strategic use of **multiple safe harbors** applied to different expenses:

**Why small taxpayer safe harbor doesn't work:**
- Threshold: Lesser of $10,000 or 2% × $800,000 = $16,000, so $10,000
- Total costs: $13,000 > $10,000 ✗ (all-or-nothing election fails)

**Optimal strategy - combining safe harbors:**

1. **Routine maintenance safe harbor:**
   - HVAC (every 5 years): More than once in 10 years ✓ → **expense $6,000**
   - Painting (every 7 years): More than once in 10 years ✓ → **expense $4,000**

2. **De minimis safe harbor:**
   - Supplies at $200 each: Well under $2,500/$5,000 thresholds per item ✓ → **expense $2,000**

3. **Roof patch (one-time):**
   - Doesn't qualify for routine maintenance (not recurring)
   - Must analyze under BAR tests → **likely capitalize $1,000**

**Result:** Expense $12,000 immediately, capitalize only $1,000. By analyzing each expenditure individually and applying the most appropriate safe harbor, you maximize current deductions rather than defaulting to full capitalization when one safe harbor doesn't cover everything.

## Question 10
Why is the de minimis safe harbor becoming MORE valuable as bonus depreciation phases out (0% by 2027 under pre-OBBBA law)?

A) The dollar thresholds increase as bonus decreases
B) Immediate expensing becomes more valuable when capitalized items must be depreciated over full recovery periods
C) The written policy requirement is waived when bonus is unavailable
D) More items qualify for the safe harbor when bonus is lower

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is a critical strategic insight for cost segregation planning! As bonus depreciation phases out, the difference between immediate expensing and capitalizing becomes much more significant:

**When bonus was 100%:** Capitalizing small items still provided immediate tax benefits through bonus depreciation (100% first-year deduction).

**As bonus phases out (60% → 40% → 20% → 0%):** Capitalized items must increasingly be depreciated over their full recovery periods (5, 7, 15, or 39 years), making immediate expensing through safe harbors **much more valuable**.

**Why this matters:**
- De minimis safe harbor thresholds ($2,500/$5,000) don't change
- But the **value** of using them increases dramatically
- The policy must be in place at the **beginning** of the tax year, so proactive planning is essential
- Even "small" amounts add up when immediate expensing beats multi-year depreciation

This is exactly the type of proactive tax planning cost segregation professionals should be advising clients on as the tax landscape changes post-TCJA.
