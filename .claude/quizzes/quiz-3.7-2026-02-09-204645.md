## Question 1
What is the primary purpose of Section 179 expensing under IRC §179?

A) To allow taxpayers to spread equipment costs evenly over the asset's useful life
B) To allow taxpayers to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment up to an annual limit in the year placed in service
C) To provide accelerated depreciation exclusively for real property structures
D) To require taxpayers to capitalize all equipment purchases over $10,000

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Section 179 expensing allows taxpayers to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and software up to a specific annual limit in the year the asset is placed in service, rather than depreciating it over time through MACRS. This immediate expensing provision provides significant cash flow benefits by front-loading deductions in the first year. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025, the deduction limit was increased to $2.5 million (up from $1.25 million), with a phase-out threshold of $4 million (up from $3.13 million). Section 179 is particularly valuable for small and medium-sized businesses making equipment purchases, as it allows immediate cost recovery rather than spreading deductions over multiple years.

## Question 2
Under OBBBA 2025, what are the current Section 179 deduction limit and phase-out threshold for property placed in service in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024?

A) $1,250,000 deduction limit and $3,130,000 phase-out threshold
B) $1,500,000 deduction limit and $3,500,000 phase-out threshold
C) $2,500,000 deduction limit and $4,000,000 phase-out threshold
D) $3,000,000 deduction limit and $5,000,000 phase-out threshold

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) enacted in July 2025, the Section 179 deduction limit was substantially increased to $2.5 million, with a phase-out threshold of $4 million for property placed in service in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. This represents a doubling from the prior limits of $1.25 million and $3.13 million (choice A shows the pre-OBBBA amounts). Both the deduction limit and phase-out threshold continue to be adjusted annually for inflation—for 2026 specifically, these amounts are $2.56 million and $4.09 million. This significant increase makes Section 179 much more valuable for businesses, particularly when combined with the permanent 100% bonus depreciation also restored by OBBBA for property acquired after January 19, 2025.

[Note: As of 2025, current law under OBBBA provides $2.5M deduction limit and $4M phase-out threshold, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024]

## Question 3
Which of the following types of real property improvements now qualify for Section 179 expensing?

A) Building foundations, structural walls, and load-bearing columns
B) Roofs, HVAC systems, fire protection and alarm systems, and security systems
C) Parking lots, sidewalks, and landscaping improvements
D) Elevators, escalators, and building expansion projects

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Recent tax legislation expanded Section 179 to include specific real property improvements for non-residential (commercial) buildings: roofs, HVAC systems, fire protection and alarm systems, and security systems. These improvements must be made after the building was first placed in service and are subject to the annual Section 179 dollar limits. This expansion is particularly valuable for real estate investors and commercial property owners conducting renovations or upgrades. Building foundations and structural elements (choice A) remain classified as part of the building structure and don't qualify. Parking lots, sidewalks, and landscaping (choice C) are typically classified as 15-year land improvements and qualify for bonus depreciation but not Section 179. Elevators and escalators (choice D) are separately classified equipment that may qualify for Section 179 as personal property but are not part of the "real property improvements" expansion referenced in the question.

## Question 4
A business purchases $3,000,000 in qualifying equipment in 2025. What Section 179 deduction can they claim under OBBBA 2025 rules (assuming no taxable income limitations)?

A) $1,250,000 (the pre-OBBBA limit)
B) $2,500,000 (the full OBBBA 2025 limit, since purchases are below the phase-out threshold)
C) $3,000,000 (full expensing of all equipment purchased)
D) $2,000,000 (phased-out amount based on exceeding thresholds)

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Since the business purchased $3 million in qualifying equipment, which is below the $4 million phase-out threshold under OBBBA 2025, they can claim the full Section 179 deduction of $2.5 million (assuming sufficient taxable income). The phase-out only begins when total equipment purchases exceed $4 million—at that point, the deduction is reduced dollar-for-dollar for every dollar over the threshold. For example, if they had purchased $4.5 million in equipment, the deduction would be reduced by $500,000 ($4.5M - $4M threshold), leaving a $2 million deduction ($2.5M - $0.5M reduction). In this scenario, with $3 million in purchases, no phase-out applies. The business would Section 179 expense $2.5 million immediately and could then claim 100% bonus depreciation on the remaining $500,000 basis (under OBBBA's permanent bonus provisions), resulting in complete first-year expensing of all $3 million.

## Question 5
What is the taxable income limitation for Section 179 deductions?

A) There is no limitation—Section 179 can create unlimited tax losses
B) The deduction cannot exceed the taxpayer's taxable income from active business operations; unused amounts carry forward
C) The deduction is limited to 50% of taxable income in any given year
D) The deduction can only offset passive income, not active business income

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Section 179 has a critical taxable income limitation—the deduction cannot exceed the taxpayer's taxable income from the active conduct of any trade or business during the year. This prevents taxpayers from using Section 179 to create or increase tax losses. If the Section 179 deduction would exceed taxable income, the excess is carried forward indefinitely to future years and can be used when sufficient taxable income exists. For example, if a business has $1.5 million in taxable income and elects $2.5 million in Section 179 expensing, only $1.5 million can be deducted in the current year, with the remaining $1 million carried forward. This is different from bonus depreciation, which has no taxable income limitation and can create NOLs. The taxable income for this purpose is calculated before the Section 179 deduction itself, ensuring businesses with minimal profits cannot over-expense assets beyond their economic capacity to absorb deductions.

## Question 6
A commercial property owner installs a new HVAC system in their office building for $150,000 in 2025. The building was originally placed in service in 2018. Can they claim Section 179 expensing for this improvement?

A) No, because Section 179 only applies to equipment and personal property, never to real property improvements
B) No, because the HVAC system was installed more than 3 years after the building was placed in service
C) Yes, because HVAC systems for non-residential real property placed in service after the building qualify for Section 179
D) Yes, but only if they also elect out of bonus depreciation for all property acquired that year

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Yes, the HVAC system qualifies for Section 179 expensing. Recent tax legislation expanded Section 179 to include specific real property improvements for non-residential (commercial) buildings, including HVAC systems, roofs, fire protection and alarm systems, and security systems. The key requirements are: (1) the improvement must be for non-residential real property (the office building qualifies), and (2) the improvement must be made after the building was first placed in service (2025 installation is after the 2018 placed-in-service date). There is no 3-year waiting period requirement (choice B is incorrect). The $150,000 HVAC system is well below the $2.5 million Section 179 limit under OBBBA 2025, so the full amount can be immediately expensed (subject to taxable income limitations). This expansion makes Section 179 particularly valuable for commercial property owners conducting building system upgrades and renovations.

## Question 7
A business purchases $4.5 million in qualifying equipment in 2025 under OBBBA rules. How much Section 179 deduction can they claim (ignoring taxable income limitations)?

A) $2,500,000 (the full limit, since the phase-out doesn't apply until $5 million)
B) $2,000,000 (the $2.5M limit reduced by $500,000 for exceeding the $4M threshold)
C) $1,250,000 (half of the original limit due to phase-out)
D) $0 (completely phased out since purchases exceed $4 million)

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The Section 179 deduction is subject to a dollar-for-dollar phase-out once total equipment purchases exceed the $4 million threshold under OBBBA 2025. The calculation is: Equipment purchases ($4.5M) minus phase-out threshold ($4M) equals $500,000 over the threshold. The maximum Section 179 deduction ($2.5M) is then reduced by this $500,000 excess, resulting in a $2 million allowable deduction. The phase-out is complete (deduction reduced to $0) when total purchases reach $6.5 million ($4M threshold + $2.5M limit = $6.5M). This phase-out mechanism ensures Section 179's benefits are targeted toward small and medium-sized businesses rather than extremely large capital expenditures. Note that the $500,000 of equipment that couldn't be Section 179 expensed would still qualify for 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA (for property acquired after January 19, 2025), so the business could still achieve full first-year expensing of the entire $4.5 million purchase.

## Question 8
A tax strategist is advising a client who will purchase $3.5 million in equipment in 2025 and expects $1.8 million in taxable income. The client asks whether to use Section 179, bonus depreciation, or a combination. Analyze the optimal strategy considering the Section 179 taxable income limitation, OBBBA 2025 permanent 100% bonus depreciation, and IRC §163(j) business interest limitation interactions.

A) Use Section 179 for the full $2.5M limit since it's always better to maximize Section 179 first
B) Use only 100% bonus depreciation on all $3.5M since bonus has no taxable income limitation
C) Use Section 179 for $1.8M (limited by taxable income) and bonus depreciation for the remaining $1.7M to achieve full first-year expensing
D) Split evenly between Section 179 and bonus to diversify depreciation methods

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This is the sophisticated tax planning approach that maximizes first-year expensing while respecting the Section 179 taxable income limitation. Since the client has only $1.8 million in taxable income, they can use Section 179 for $1.8 million (the taxable income limitation prevents using the full $2.5M limit). The remaining $1.7 million ($3.5M total - $1.8M Section 179 = $1.7M) can be immediately expensed using 100% bonus depreciation, which has no taxable income limitation. This achieves complete first-year expensing of all $3.5 million in equipment purchases.

An important nuance involves IRC §163(j) business interest limitations: For calculating adjusted taxable income (ATI) under §163(j), Section 179 deductions are added back (don't reduce ATI), while bonus depreciation deductions do reduce ATI. If the client has significant business interest expense subject to §163(j) limitations, using Section 179 first helps preserve ATI and maintain greater interest deduction capacity. However, for most clients, the combination strategy (C) optimally achieves immediate full expensing while working within the Section 179 taxable income constraint. Choice B (using only bonus) works but unnecessarily wastes available Section 179 capacity.

## Question 9
A real estate investor is planning significant building improvements for multiple commercial properties in 2025-2026. The improvements will include new roofs ($800,000), HVAC replacements ($600,000), security systems ($200,000), and interior tenant improvements ($1,500,000). How should the investor strategically deploy Section 179 expensing versus bonus depreciation to maximize tax benefits across both years, considering the OBBBA 2025 permanent provisions?

A) Use Section 179 for all improvements since real property improvements now qualify, avoiding the complexity of bonus depreciation elections
B) Use Section 179 for the qualifying real property improvements (roofs, HVAC, security) up to the annual limit, and bonus depreciation for interior tenant improvements (QIP), spreading improvements across 2025-2026 based on taxable income projections
C) Use only bonus depreciation for everything since it's simpler and has no taxable income limitation
D) Defer all improvements until after 2026 when tax rates may be more favorable

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the sophisticated multi-year tax planning strategy that optimally deploys both Section 179 and bonus depreciation. The roofs, HVAC systems, and security systems ($1.6M total) qualify for Section 179 as real property improvements under the expanded rules. The interior tenant improvements ($1.5M) qualify as Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) eligible for 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025. The strategic approach involves:

**Section 179 deployment**: Use for the qualifying real property improvements (roofs, HVAC, security), but respect the taxable income limitation by spreading these improvements across 2025-2026 based on projected taxable income in each year. For example, if 2025 taxable income is projected at $1M, use Section 179 for $1M of these improvements in 2025, with the remaining $600,000 in 2026.

**Bonus depreciation deployment**: Use for the interior tenant improvements (QIP), which have no taxable income limitation and receive immediate 100% expensing regardless of when placed in service.

**IRC §163(j) consideration**: Using Section 179 (which doesn't reduce ATI) for the real property improvements helps preserve business interest deduction capacity if the investor has significant debt financing.

This strategy maximizes tax benefits while maintaining flexibility across multiple years, unlike choice A (ignores taxable income limitations) or choice C (wastes Section 179 capacity and potentially impacts §163(j) ATI unnecessarily).

## Question 10
Congress is considering potential modifications to Section 179 in future tax legislation. A CFO asks their tax advisor how the "permanent" nature of OBBBA 2025's increased Section 179 limits ($2.5M/$4M) compares to bonus depreciation's permanence, and how this affects long-term capital planning. What is the most sophisticated analysis?

A) Both Section 179 and bonus depreciation are now permanently fixed at current levels and cannot be changed by Congress
B) While both are labeled "permanent" (no sunset provisions), Congress can modify either provision; however, Section 179 limits continue to be inflation-adjusted annually, while bonus depreciation is a fixed 100% rate, creating different legislative risk profiles that should inform multi-year capital planning strategies
C) Section 179 is more permanent than bonus depreciation because it's been in the tax code longer
D) The CFO should ignore permanence discussions and assume all provisions will be eliminated by 2027

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the most sophisticated and professionally sound analysis of "permanent" tax provisions. Both Section 179's increased limits ($2.5M/$4M under OBBBA) and bonus depreciation's 100% rate are labeled "permanent," meaning they have no built-in sunset provisions or automatic phase-downs. However, Congress retains constitutional authority to modify any tax law through future legislation—"permanent" simply means affirmative Congressional action would be required to change them, rather than having automatic expiration.

**Key differences create distinct risk profiles**:

**Section 179**: The $2.5M deduction limit and $4M phase-out threshold are indexed for inflation annually (e.g., $2.56M/$4.09M for 2026). This automatic adjustment means the limits grow over time without Congressional action, but also creates annual complexity in planning. The inflation adjustment mechanism somewhat insulates Section 179 from need for legislative updates.

**Bonus depreciation**: Fixed at 100% with no scheduled phase-down. Simple and predictable, but any future reduction would require explicit legislative change. No inflation adjustment needed since it's a percentage.

**Planning implications**: The CFO should plan under current law while monitoring legislative developments. The automatic inflation adjustment of Section 179 provides some protection against erosion of real value, while bonus depreciation's simplicity (fixed 100%) makes it easier to model but potentially more vulnerable to future legislative targeting. Both provisions' permanence significantly reduces pressure to rush capital expenditures compared to sunset provisions, enabling more strategic, economically-driven investment timing.
