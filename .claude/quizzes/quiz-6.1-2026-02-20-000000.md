## Question 1
Which of the following correctly describes a characteristic of Section 1245 property?

A) Depreciated over 27.5 or 39 years using the straight-line method
B) Subject to partial recapture at a 25% maximum tax rate upon sale
C) Eligible for accelerated depreciation with recovery periods of 5, 7, or 15 years
D) Includes building shell, structural framing, and central HVAC systems

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Section 1245 property is characterized by shorter recovery periods (5, 7, or 15 years) and eligibility for accelerated depreciation methods such as 200% declining balance. It includes tangible personal property and other tangible property used in business operations — machinery, equipment, furniture, removable partitions, and process-specific systems. Options A and B describe §1250 property characteristics, and option D lists §1250 structural components.

## Question 2
Under IRC §1250, which depreciation method is required for real property?

A) 200% declining balance
B) 150% declining balance
C) Straight-line
D) Sum-of-years-digits

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: Section 1250 property must use the straight-line depreciation method — 27.5 years for residential real property and 39 years for nonresidential real property. This is one of the key distinctions from §1245 property, which is eligible for accelerated methods (200% declining balance for 5 and 7-year property). The straight-line requirement for §1250 property is also why the recapture treatment differs — §1250 recapture only applies to depreciation taken *in excess* of straight-line (which under current MACRS is zero, since straight-line is required), resulting in the 25% unrecaptured §1250 gain rate rather than full ordinary income recapture.

## Question 3
When Section 1245 property is sold at a gain, how is the recaptured depreciation taxed?

A) At a 25% maximum rate as unrecaptured §1250 gain
B) As ordinary income at the taxpayer's full marginal rate
C) As long-term capital gain at 15% or 20%
D) At a flat 28% rate regardless of the taxpayer's bracket

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Section 1245 property is subject to **full ordinary income recapture** upon sale. This means that all depreciation previously claimed is recaptured and taxed at the taxpayer's ordinary income marginal tax rate (which can be as high as 37%). This is significantly different from §1250 property, which receives preferential treatment — unrecaptured §1250 gain is taxed at a maximum 25% rate, and only depreciation in excess of straight-line is recaptured as ordinary income (which under current MACRS is zero). The harsh §1245 recapture is the trade-off for the benefit of accelerated depreciation during the holding period.

## Question 4
A cost segregation analyst is reviewing a hotel renovation and identifies the following components: (1) removable partition walls, (2) built-in lobby furniture, (3) structural roof framing, (4) central HVAC chillers. Which components qualify as Section 1245 property?

A) Structural roof framing and central HVAC chillers only
B) Removable partition walls and built-in lobby furniture only
C) All four items qualify as Section 1245 property
D) None — hotel property is exclusively Section 1250 real property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Removable partition walls and built-in lobby furniture are both Section 1245 property. The study material specifically identifies "furniture and fixtures" and "removable partitions" as §1245 examples — they are tangible personal property not integral to the building structure. In contrast, structural roof framing and central HVAC chillers are §1250 property because they are structural components necessary for the building's general operation. The central HVAC serves the entire building (not a specific process), and structural framing is part of the building shell. This distinction is critical in cost segregation — only the removable partitions and furniture can be reclassified for accelerated depreciation.

## Question 5
A manufacturing facility was placed in service in 2020. The owner claimed $2 million in Section 1245 depreciation using 100% bonus depreciation on cost-segregated components. In 2026, she sells the property at a substantial gain. What are the tax implications of the $2 million Section 1245 depreciation claimed?

A) The $2 million is treated as long-term capital gain at 15-20% rates
B) The $2 million is recaptured as ordinary income at her marginal tax rate
C) No recapture applies since 100% bonus depreciation is exempt from recapture rules
D) The $2 million is recaptured at the 25% unrecaptured §1250 gain rate

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Section 1245 property is subject to **full ordinary income recapture** regardless of how the depreciation was claimed. The $2 million of depreciation — even though claimed as 100% bonus depreciation — will be recaptured as ordinary income at the taxpayer's marginal rate (potentially up to 37%). Bonus depreciation does not exempt property from recapture rules; it merely accelerates the deduction timing. The 25% unrecaptured §1250 gain rate (option D) applies only to Section 1250 real property depreciation, not §1245 personal property. This is why the web search noted the "acceleration trap" — taking immediate 100% bonus on reclassified components "converts your entire reclassified basis into future ordinary income" upon sale.

## Question 6
An office building's HVAC system requires replacement work: (a) the central chiller unit serving the entire building, and (b) a specialized process cooling unit serving only the server room with dedicated temperature/humidity controls. How does the §1245/§1250 distinction apply?

A) Both items are §1250 property since they are HVAC-related and serve the building
B) Both items are §1245 property since HVAC equipment qualifies as tangible personal property
C) The central building chiller is §1250 property; the specialized process cooling unit serving the server room may qualify as §1245 property
D) Classification depends solely on the property's placed-in-service date

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This question illustrates a critical functional distinction. The central chiller serving the entire building is a "structural component" necessary for the building's general operation and maintenance — it's §1250 property. However, the specialized process cooling unit serving only the server room with dedicated controls is "process-specific" and used as an integral part of a specific business activity (data center operations), which may qualify it as §1245 property. The study material identifies "Central HVAC systems" as §1250 examples but "Process-specific systems" as §1245 examples. The distinction is based on function and use, not simply the equipment type — general building systems vs. systems integral to specific business operations.

## Question 7
A cost segregation study reclassifies $500,000 of electrical wiring from §1250 to §1245 for dedicated machinery circuits in a factory. The owner plans to sell in 5 years. What is the most significant tax consequence of this reclassification that the owner should understand before proceeding?

A) The reclassified amount will permanently escape depreciation recapture
B) Upon sale, the $500,000 of depreciation claimed will be subject to full ordinary income recapture rather than the 25% §1250 rate
C) The reclassification means no depreciation can be claimed on these circuits
D) The §1245 recapture rate is always lower than the §1250 rate, so reclassification is always preferred

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This captures the critical trade-off in cost segregation. While reclassifying the electrical wiring from §1250 (39-year) to §1245 (5-7 year) accelerates depreciation deductions and improves cash flow during the holding period, it also changes the tax treatment upon sale. The $500,000 of depreciation that would have been taxed at the 25% unrecaptured §1250 gain rate will instead be fully recaptured as ordinary income (potentially at 37%). The benefit of cost segregation comes from the time value of money — receiving accelerated deductions now versus slower deductions later — but the owner must understand that the recapture exposure has also increased. This is why sophisticated analysis considers both the holding period and the present value of the tax deferral.

## Question 8
A tax advisor argues that cost segregation always provides a net benefit regardless of holding period because accelerated deductions are inherently valuable. A senior analyst disagrees, citing §1245 recapture rules. Which response best captures the analytical framework for evaluating this tension?

A) The tax advisor is correct — accelerated deductions are always beneficial since money has time value
B) The senior analyst is correct — §1245 recapture eliminates all benefit from cost segregation at sale
C) The benefit depends on the time value of money versus recapture cost: accelerated §1245 deductions provide upfront cash flow, but trigger ordinary income recapture upon sale — the net benefit is the present value of the tax deferral, not elimination
D) The disagreement is irrelevant because §1031 like-kind exchanges always eliminate recapture exposure

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Option C correctly captures the sophisticated analytical framework. Cost segregation doesn't eliminate taxes — it defers them by front-loading deductions. The taxpayer receives accelerated §1245 deductions at ordinary rates during the holding period, but those same deductions are recaptured at ordinary rates upon sale. The benefit is the **time value of money** from the tax deferral — having cash now versus later has economic value even if the total tax paid over the property's lifecycle is similar (or even slightly higher due to recapture). Option A ignores recapture exposure; option B overstates the negative impact by claiming "all benefit" is eliminated (the deferral itself has value); and option D is wrong because §1031 exchanges defer recognition but don't eliminate recapture — the recapture exposure carries over to the replacement property.

## Question 9
A client owns a mixed-use commercial building with both §1245 and §1250 components. She asks why the cost segregation study must specifically identify and document each reclassified component rather than applying a general percentage allocation. From a §1245/§1250 perspective, why is component-level documentation critical?

A) Component-level documentation is required by GAAP accounting standards but not by tax law
B) The §1245/§1250 distinction depends on the nature and function of each specific component — accurate recapture calculations at sale require knowing exactly which components were reclassified, their basis, and depreciation claimed on each
C) Documentation is only required for components exceeding $50,000 in individual value
D) Component-level detail is necessary only if the taxpayer elects out of bonus depreciation

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Component-level documentation is critical because the §1245/§1250 classification is based on the **nature and function** of each individual component, not a blanket percentage. At sale, the taxpayer must calculate recapture separately for §1245 property (full ordinary income recapture) versus §1250 property (25% unrecaptured gain). Without detailed records showing which specific components were reclassified, their original basis, recovery periods, and depreciation claimed, it's impossible to perform accurate recapture calculations. The IRS can also challenge unsupported allocations during audit. This is why quality cost segregation studies include detailed asset listings with engineering support — not just percentage-based estimates.

## Question 10
A real estate firm acquires a warehouse in 2026, performs a cost segregation study reclassifying $800,000 to §1245 property and claims 100% bonus depreciation. They sell the warehouse in 2027 — just one year later — for a $1.5 million gain. How does the §1245/§1250 framework apply to this sale?

A) The entire $1.5 million gain is taxed as long-term capital gain since the property is real estate
B) The $800,000 of §1245 depreciation is fully recaptured as ordinary income; the remaining gain is analyzed under §1250 rules (25% rate on unrecaptured straight-line depreciation) and capital gain treatment
C) No recapture applies since the sale occurred within one year and the gain is short-term
D) The $800,000 is split evenly between ordinary income and long-term capital gain

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This scenario demonstrates how §1245 and §1250 recapture work together in practice. The $800,000 of §1245 depreciation claimed (via 100% bonus) is **fully recaptured as ordinary income** regardless of the holding period — §1245 recapture applies to all depreciation taken, and the one-year holding period doesn't exempt it. The remaining $700,000 gain ($1.5M total - $800K §1245 recapture) is then analyzed under the general gain rules: any §1250 straight-line depreciation claimed during the one year is unrecaptured §1250 gain (25% rate), and the balance is capital gain (which would be short-term at ordinary rates since held less than one year). This illustrates the "acceleration trap" mentioned in recent guidance — immediate 100% expensing converts the entire reclassified basis into ordinary income recapture, which can be particularly harsh on short holding periods.
