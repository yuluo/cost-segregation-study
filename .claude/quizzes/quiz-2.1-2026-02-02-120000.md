## Question 1
What is cost segregation?

A) A method of calculating property insurance premiums based on building components
B) A specialized process to identify and reclassify property components into qualified assets categorized as tangible personal property or land improvements under federal tax code
C) A general accounting procedure for splitting costs between departments in an organization
D) A real estate appraisal technique used to determine fair market value of commercial properties

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Cost segregation is specifically defined as a specialized process used to identify and reclassify property components into qualified assets categorized as "tangible personal property" or "land improvements" under federal tax code. It is not an insurance, appraisal, or general accounting procedure.

## Question 2
What is the standard depreciation life for non-residential real property?

A) 27.5 years
B) 31.5 years
C) 39 years
D) 40 years

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: Non-residential real property has a standard depreciation life of 39 years under MACRS. Residential rental property uses 27.5 years. The 31.5-year period was used under older tax rules prior to 1993.

## Question 3
Which of the following are the shorter recovery periods that cost segregation aims to reclassify assets into?

A) 3, 10, or 20 years
B) 5, 7, or 15 years
C) 1, 5, or 10 years
D) 7, 10, or 20 years

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Cost segregation reclassifies property components into 5-year, 7-year, or 15-year recovery periods, which are significantly shorter than the standard 39-year or 27.5-year lives.

## Question 4
A commercial property owner purchased an office building for $2 million. Without cost segregation, the entire building (excluding land) would be depreciated over 39 years. If a cost segregation study identifies $400,000 of assets that qualify for 5-year depreciation, what is the primary financial benefit to the owner?

A) The total depreciation amount increases over the life of the property
B) The owner pays less total tax over the life of the property
C) The owner receives larger tax deductions in the early years, improving cash flow through the time value of money
D) The property's assessed value decreases for property tax purposes

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: Cost segregation does not change the total depreciation available -- it accelerates it. By shifting $400,000 into 5-year property, the owner receives much larger deductions in the first several years. Due to the time value of money, receiving tax savings sooner is worth more than the same savings spread over 39 years.

## Question 5
A property owner asks whether cost segregation applies to their residential rental property. What is the standard depreciation life they would be comparing the shorter lives against?

A) 39 years
B) 31.5 years
C) 27.5 years
D) 20 years

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: Residential rental property has a standard MACRS depreciation life of 27.5 years. Cost segregation would reclassify qualifying components from this 27.5-year life to shorter 5, 7, or 15-year recovery periods.

## Question 6
An investor purchases a retail building and wants to maximize first-year tax deductions. Which strategy does cost segregation use to achieve this goal?

A) Deferring depreciation to later years when the owner's tax bracket may be higher
B) Accelerating depreciation by reclassifying building components to shorter recovery periods
C) Eliminating depreciation entirely and expensing the full purchase price in year one
D) Converting ordinary depreciation deductions into capital gains treatment

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Cost segregation accelerates depreciation by identifying building components that qualify for shorter recovery periods (5, 7, or 15 years) rather than the standard 39-year life. This results in larger deductions in earlier years.

## Question 7
A CPA recommends cost segregation to a client who just purchased a warehouse. The client asks, "What kinds of property components get reclassified?" Which answer best reflects the two primary reclassification categories?

A) Structural components and roofing materials
B) Tangible personal property and land improvements
C) Building shell and mechanical systems
D) Interior finishes and exterior facades

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: The two primary categories that cost segregation reclassifies building components into are "tangible personal property" and "land improvements." These are the specific federal tax code classifications that qualify for shorter depreciation lives.

## Question 8
Cost segregation provides a "time value of money advantage." In the context of total depreciation over the life of a property, which statement is most accurate?

A) Cost segregation increases the total amount of depreciation that can be claimed over the property's life
B) Cost segregation reduces the total amount of depreciation that can be claimed over the property's life
C) Cost segregation does not change total depreciation but shifts larger deductions to earlier years, making each dollar of tax savings worth more in present value
D) Cost segregation changes the depreciation method from straight-line to double-declining balance for the entire property

**Correct Answer**: C
**Explanation**: Cost segregation does not create additional depreciation -- the total depreciation over the property's useful life remains the same. However, by front-loading deductions into earlier years, the present value of those tax savings is greater. A dollar saved today is worth more than a dollar saved 30 years from now.

## Question 9
Prior to the formation of the ASCSP in 2006, what was the state of the cost segregation industry regarding professional oversight?

A) The IRS directly certified all cost segregation practitioners
B) The industry had no professional certification or reporting standards
C) CPAs were the only professionals permitted to perform cost segregation studies
D) The National Association of Realtors governed cost segregation standards

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: Prior to the formation of the ASCSP in 2006, the cost segregation industry had no professional certification or reporting standards. The ASCSP was established specifically to address this gap by creating educational programs, minimum quality standards, and a Code of Ethics.

## Question 10
Consider a scenario where an owner has both a non-residential commercial building and a residential rental property. Both properties have components that could be reclassified to 5-year or 15-year property. For which property does the "acceleration gap" (the difference between standard life and shorter life) provide a potentially greater percentage benefit, and why?

A) The residential property, because 27.5 years is already a shorter life so the reclassified assets represent a larger proportion of remaining depreciation
B) The non-residential property, because the gap between 39 years and 5 or 15 years is larger, meaning more depreciation is shifted to earlier years
C) Both properties benefit equally because the shorter recovery periods are the same regardless of property type
D) Neither property benefits more because cost segregation only applies to newly constructed buildings

**Correct Answer**: B
**Explanation**: The non-residential commercial property has a 39-year standard life, meaning the "acceleration gap" when reclassifying to 5 or 15-year property is much larger (34 or 24 years of acceleration) compared to the residential property's 27.5-year life (22.5 or 12.5 years of acceleration). This larger gap means proportionally more depreciation is shifted to earlier years for the non-residential property.
