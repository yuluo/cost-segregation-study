## Question 1
Interior improvements to a nonresidential building (new lighting, flooring, and partition walls) are made after the building was first placed in service. What property class do these Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) items fall under for MACRS GDS?

A) 7-year property
B) 10-year property
C) 15-year property
D) 20-year property

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) is classified as 15-year property under MACRS GDS. QIP includes interior improvements (such as lighting, flooring, partition walls, HVAC modifications) made to nonresidential buildings after they were first placed in service. This 15-year classification makes QIP eligible for bonus depreciation and faster cost recovery compared to the 39-year building structure. Under ADS, QIP has a 20-year recovery period.

## Question 2
What is the residential rental property recovery period under MACRS, and what percentage of gross rental revenue must come from dwelling units to qualify?

A) 27.5 years; 80% or more
B) 27.5 years; 50% or more
C) 39 years; 80% or more
D) 31.5 years; 75% or more

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: Residential rental property has a 27.5-year recovery period under MACRS. To qualify for this classification, 80% or more of the gross rental revenue must come from dwelling units (residential use). If this threshold is not met, the property is classified as nonresidential real property with a 39-year recovery period. This distinction is crucial for tax planning and cost segregation studies.

## Question 3
Under MACRS GDS, what depreciation method is applied to 7-year property such as office furniture and fixtures?

A) Straight-line
B) 150% declining balance
C) 200% declining balance
D) Sum-of-the-years-digits

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Under MACRS GDS, 7-year property (office furniture, fixtures, most machinery and equipment) uses the 200% declining balance depreciation method. This accelerated method is the same used for 5-year property. In contrast, 15-year land improvements use 150% declining balance, and real property (27.5 and 39-year) uses straight-line depreciation. The 200% declining balance provides faster depreciation deductions in earlier years.

## Question 4
A taxpayer places $500,000 of equipment in service in June 2026 and $480,000 of equipment in service in October 2026. Total equipment for the year is $980,000. Which depreciation convention applies?

A) Half-year convention, because 48.98% is less than 50% in Q4
B) Mid-quarter convention, because $480K/$980K = 48.98% exceeds the 40% threshold
C) Half-year convention, because October is not in the last quarter
D) Mid-month convention for all personal property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The mid-quarter convention applies when MORE than 40% of the total depreciable basis of personal property (excluding real property) is placed in service during the last quarter (Q4: October, November, December). Here, $480,000 of $980,000 (48.98%) was placed in Q4, which exceeds the 40% threshold. Therefore, the mid-quarter convention applies to all personal property placed in service during 2026. This is a critical determination that affects depreciation calculations for the entire year.

## Question 5
A cost segregation study identifies the following components in a restaurant: (1) specialized kitchen equipment, (2) custom booth seating bolted to the floor, (3) exterior signage, (4) the building's sprinkler system. Which items can typically be reclassified to shorter recovery periods?

A) All four items can be reclassified to 5 or 7-year property
B) Kitchen equipment (5-year) and booth seating (7-year); but NOT signage or sprinklers
C) Kitchen equipment (5-year), booth seating (7-year), and exterior signage (7-year); but NOT the sprinkler system
D) Only the kitchen equipment; all other items remain 39-year property

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Kitchen equipment (appliances) is 5-year property, custom booth seating (fixtures) is 7-year property, and exterior signage is typically 7-year property - all can be reclassified through cost segregation. However, the building's sprinkler system is a structural component that serves the entire building for fire safety and remains 39-year real property. Only HVAC or other systems serving specific tenant spaces (not the whole building) can potentially be reclassified. This distinction between separable personal property and structural components is fundamental to cost segregation.

## Question 6
A taxpayer places $400,000 of equipment in service in March, $300,000 in August, and $392,000 in December. Total: $1,092,000. What percentage is placed in Q4, and which convention applies?

A) 35.9% in Q4; half-year convention applies because it's less than 40%
B) 40.0% in Q4; half-year convention applies because it equals but doesn't exceed 40%
C) 35.9% in Q4; mid-quarter convention applies
D) 63.4% in Q4; mid-quarter convention applies

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: Q4 consists of October, November, and December. Only the December placement counts toward Q4. $392,000 / $1,092,000 = 35.9%, which does NOT exceed the 40% threshold. The mid-quarter convention requires MORE than 40% (>40%) to be placed in Q4. Since 35.9% is less than 40%, the half-year convention applies to all the equipment. This is a key distinction: the threshold must be EXCEEDED, not merely met.

## Question 7
A taxpayer has depreciated a commercial building as 39-year property for 2024 and 2025. In 2026, they perform a cost segregation study that identifies $200K of 5-year property and $150K of QIP installed in 2026. What is required to implement these results?

A) File Form 3115 for the 5-year reclassification; the 2026 QIP can be classified as 15-year without Form 3115
B) File Form 3115 for both the 5-year components and the 2026 QIP
C) No Form 3115 needed; the study can be implemented immediately
D) File Form 3115 only for the QIP classification

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: The building was depreciated as 39-year property in both 2024 and 2025, so the depreciation method is "established" under the Two Consecutive Year Rule. Reclassifying the $200K of 5-year building components requires Form 3115 (change in accounting method) because you're changing an established method. However, the $150K of QIP installed in 2026 is NEW property being placed in service for the first time - there's no established method to change. It can be properly classified as 15-year QIP from the start without Form 3115. Form 3115 is only needed when CHANGING an established method, not when correctly classifying new property.

## Question 8
A taxpayer is deciding between implementing a cost segregation study in 2026 or waiting until 2027. The study identifies $1M of 5-year property, $500K of 15-year QIP, and $300K of 15-year land improvements. Assuming the phased bonus depreciation schedule (20% in 2026, 0% in 2027+), what is the primary financial consideration?

A) Waiting until 2027 provides more deductions because there's a full year of depreciation
B) Implementing in 2026 captures 20% bonus on eligible property; delaying to 2027 loses this benefit entirely
C) The timing doesn't matter because all properties get the same total depreciation over their lives
D) Only the 5-year property benefits from timing; QIP and land improvements are unaffected

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the phased bonus depreciation schedule, eligible property placed in service in 2026 qualifies for 20% bonus depreciation, while property placed in service in 2027 or later gets 0% bonus. By implementing the cost segregation study in 2026, the taxpayer can claim 20% bonus on the $1M of 5-year property and potentially on the QIP (if it qualifies as new property). Waiting until 2027 means losing this bonus benefit entirely. While the total depreciation over the property's life remains the same, the timing and present value of tax savings favor immediate implementation to capture the remaining bonus depreciation before it expires.

## Question 9
A taxpayer places the following in service in 2026: $600K equipment in May, $200K equipment in September, $300K equipment in November, and a $3M building in October. For the mid-quarter convention test, what percentage of personal property was placed in Q4, and which conventions apply?

A) 27.3% in Q4 ($300K/$1,100K); half-year for equipment, mid-month for building
B) 9.1% in Q4 ($300K/$3,300K); half-year for all assets
C) 84.8% in Q4 ($3,300K/$3,900K); mid-quarter for all assets
D) 75% in Q4 ($300K/$400K excluding May); mid-quarter for equipment

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: For the mid-quarter convention test, real property (the $3M building) is EXCLUDED from the calculation. Only personal property (equipment) is considered. Total equipment: $600K + $200K + $300K = $1,100K. Q4 equipment (October, November, December): $300K in November. Percentage: $300K/$1,100K = 27.3%. Since this does NOT exceed 40%, the half-year convention applies to all equipment. The building, as 39-year real property, uses the mid-month convention regardless of the equipment placement timing. These are independent determinations - equipment follows half-year or mid-quarter rules, while real property always uses mid-month.

## Question 10
A building owner made interior improvements (QIP) costing $400K in 2025. In 2026, they conduct a cost segregation study on the original building (placed in service 2020) and identify $600K of 5-year property. Considering bonus depreciation (40% in 2025, 20% in 2026), what is the optimal strategy?

A) The 2025 QIP already received 40% bonus; only the $600K building reclassification matters for 2026
B) File Form 3115 to reclassify the building components and capture 20% bonus; the QIP classification is already final
C) Wait until 2027 to implement all changes when bonus expires to simplify planning
D) Both the QIP and building reclassification can still capture 20% bonus if implemented in 2026

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: A ✗
**Explanation**: The QIP costing $400K was placed in service in 2025, so it was eligible for 40% bonus depreciation in 2025 (assuming it was properly classified as 15-year property then). That's already final - you can't retroactively change prior-year bonus rates. The $600K of building components being reclassified through the 2026 cost segregation study were originally placed in service in 2020 with the building. While Form 3115 allows catchup depreciation, the components don't become "new" property eligible for 2026 bonus rates. The key lesson: cost segregation studies should ideally be done in the year property is placed in service to maximize bonus depreciation benefits at current rates.
