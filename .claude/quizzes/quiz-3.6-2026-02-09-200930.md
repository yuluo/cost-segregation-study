## Question 1
What is the primary definition of Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) under IRC §168(e)(6)?

A) Any improvement to a building's exterior façade made within 3 years of construction
B) Interior improvements to nonresidential real property made after the building was first placed in service
C) Structural framework modifications that enhance building safety and capacity
D) Any renovation to residential rental property that improves energy efficiency

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) under IRC §168(e)(6) is defined as any improvement made by the taxpayer to an interior portion of a building that is nonresidential real property, as long as the improvement is placed in service after the building was first placed in service by any taxpayer. This definition is critical for cost segregation purposes because QIP qualifies for a 15-year recovery period (rather than 39 years) and is eligible for 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 for property acquired after January 19, 2025. The key requirements are: (1) interior improvements, (2) nonresidential property, and (3) placed in service after the building's original service date.

## Question 2
Which of the following types of improvements are specifically EXCLUDED from the definition of Qualified Improvement Property (QIP)?

A) Interior lighting upgrades, flooring replacements, and HVAC modifications
B) Tenant improvement buildouts, interior partition walls, and electrical system upgrades
C) Enlargement of the building, elevators or escalators, and internal structural framework modifications
D) Interior plumbing improvements, ceiling replacements, and fire suppression system installations

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: IRC §168(e)(6) specifically excludes three categories from the QIP definition: (1) expenditures for the enlargement of a building, (2) elevators or escalators, and (3) the internal structural framework of the building. These exclusions are critical for cost segregation professionals to understand because they prevent certain improvements from qualifying for the favorable 15-year recovery period and 100% bonus depreciation treatment. Enlargements add to the building's overall structure (39-year property), elevators/escalators are separately classified equipment, and internal structural framework modifications affect the building's load-bearing capacity and are considered part of the building structure itself. All the items in choices A, B, and D would generally qualify as QIP if they meet the other requirements (interior improvements to nonresidential property placed in service after the building).

## Question 3
What recovery period does Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) receive under MACRS?

A) 5-year recovery period
B) 7-year recovery period
C) 15-year recovery period
D) 39-year recovery period

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) receives a 15-year recovery period under MACRS, which is significantly more favorable than the 39-year recovery period for nonresidential real property (commercial buildings). This accelerated recovery period is one of the primary benefits of QIP classification and is a key driver of tax savings in cost segregation studies. The 15-year classification allows for faster depreciation deductions over time compared to the building structure itself. Additionally, because the recovery period is 20 years or less, QIP qualifies for 100% bonus depreciation under the permanent OBBBA 2025 rules for property acquired after January 19, 2025, providing immediate full expensing in the first year. This combination of accelerated recovery and bonus depreciation eligibility makes proper QIP identification extremely valuable in tax planning.

## Question 4
A commercial office building owner completes a major interior renovation in March 2025, including new interior partition walls, upgraded lighting, replaced flooring, and installation of a new elevator. The building was originally placed in service in 2018. Which components qualify as QIP eligible for 15-year recovery and 100% bonus depreciation?

A) All components including the elevator, since they're all interior improvements
B) Only the partition walls, lighting, and flooring; the elevator is specifically excluded from QIP
C) None of the components qualify because the building is less than 10 years old
D) Only the elevator qualifies for accelerated treatment as 5-year property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The interior partition walls, upgraded lighting, and replaced flooring all qualify as QIP because they are interior improvements to nonresidential property placed in service after the building was originally placed in service (2018). These components qualify for the 15-year recovery period and 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025. However, the elevator is specifically excluded from the QIP definition under IRC §168(e)(6), regardless of when it's installed. Elevators and escalators are separately classified—typically as 5-year property under their own asset class. This scenario demonstrates why cost segregation professionals must carefully parse improvement projects to identify which components qualify as QIP versus which fall into other categories. There is no age limitation on the building for QIP purposes; the only requirement is that the improvements be made after the building's original placed-in-service date.

## Question 5
A taxpayer purchases a retail building on February 1, 2025, and immediately begins interior tenant improvements including new interior walls, flooring, and lighting, which are completed and placed in service on April 15, 2025. Does this work qualify as QIP for 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025?

A) No, because the improvements were made too soon after acquisition (within the same year)
B) Yes, because the improvements are interior improvements made after the building was placed in service and acquired after January 19, 2025
C) No, because QIP only applies to improvements made at least one year after building acquisition
D) Yes, but only if the taxpayer files Form 3115 to elect QIP treatment

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Yes, these improvements qualify as QIP eligible for 100% bonus depreciation. The key requirement for QIP is that the improvements must be placed in service after the building was first placed in service. When the taxpayer purchased the building on February 1, 2025, the building was placed in service to them at that time. The subsequent interior improvements completed on April 15, 2025, were made after the building was placed in service, satisfying the QIP requirement. There is no minimum waiting period between building acquisition and improvement completion—the improvements simply must occur after the building's placed-in-service date. Since the building was acquired on February 1, 2025 (after the January 19, 2025 OBBBA cutoff), all QIP components qualify for permanent 100% bonus depreciation, providing immediate full expensing. No Form 3115 is required for new acquisitions; that form is only needed for changes in accounting method on property already being depreciated.

## Question 6
Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) effective January 1, 2018, which of the following were separate qualified property categories with 15-year recovery periods that were later consolidated into the broader QIP definition?

A) Qualified Leasehold Improvements (QLI), Qualified Restaurant Property (QRP), and Qualified Retail Improvement Property (QRIP)
B) Qualified Business Property (QBP), Qualified Commercial Property (QCP), and Qualified Office Property (QOP)
C) Qualified Equipment Property (QEP), Qualified Furniture Property (QFP), and Qualified Fixture Property (QFxP)
D) Qualified Land Improvements (QLandI), Qualified Parking Property (QPP), and Qualified Landscaping Property (QLP)

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: A ✗
**Explanation**: Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) effective January 1, 2018, three separate qualified property categories existed with 15-year recovery periods: Qualified Leasehold Improvements (QLI), Qualified Restaurant Property (QRP), and Qualified Retail Improvement Property (QRIP). Each had specific requirements—QLI required improvements pursuant to a lease, QRP required more than 50% of square footage dedicated to food preparation and seating, and QRIP required the building to be at least 3 years old at the time of improvement. The TCJA consolidated these categories into the broader and simpler QIP definition, which eliminates the lease requirement, the restaurant-specific use requirement, and the 3-year age requirement. The consolidated QIP provides similar 15-year recovery and bonus depreciation benefits but with more flexible qualification criteria, making it easier for taxpayers to identify and claim accelerated depreciation on interior improvements.

## Question 7
A commercial building owner acquired a property on January 15, 2025 (before OBBBA) and completed $500,000 in qualifying interior improvements (QIP) on March 1, 2025 (after OBBBA effective date). What bonus depreciation rate applies to the QIP components?

A) 100% bonus because the improvements were placed in service after January 19, 2025
B) 40% bonus because the building was acquired before January 19, 2025
C) 60% bonus based on the 2024 rate carried forward
D) No bonus depreciation because the building and improvements must be acquired on the same date

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: For bonus depreciation purposes, the acquisition date of the underlying building controls the applicable bonus rate for QIP improvements, not the date the improvements are completed or placed in service. Since the building was acquired on January 15, 2025 (before the January 19, 2025 OBBBA cutoff), the property follows the pre-OBBBA phase-out schedule, which provides 40% bonus depreciation for property placed in service in 2025. Even though the actual QIP improvements were completed on March 1, 2025 (after the OBBBA effective date), they are treated as acquired when the building was acquired. This principle is important for tax planning—to capture the permanent 100% bonus depreciation on QIP under OBBBA 2025, the building itself must be acquired after January 19, 2025. This scenario demonstrates why timing building acquisitions around legislative cutoff dates can have significant tax implications, potentially worth tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on major improvement projects.

## Question 8
A real estate investor is considering two scenarios for a $2 million interior renovation project: (Scenario 1) Purchase the building on January 18, 2025, and complete renovations in March 2025; or (Scenario 2) Delay the building purchase until January 21, 2025, with the same renovation timeline. Assuming $1.5 million of the $2 million renovation qualifies as QIP, analyze the tax implications and strategic considerations.

A) Scenario 1 is better because earlier acquisition provides more time for depreciation deductions
B) Scenario 2 provides $900,000 more in first-year deductions ($1.5M × 60% difference between 40% and 100% bonus)
C) The timing difference is immaterial because both scenarios occur in the same tax year
D) Scenario 1 is better because it locks in the 40% rate before potential legislative changes

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Scenario 2 (delaying the purchase by just 3 days) provides $900,000 more in first-year tax deductions. Under Scenario 1 (January 18 acquisition), the QIP receives 40% bonus depreciation (pre-OBBBA phase-out rate), yielding $600,000 in first-year bonus deductions ($1.5M × 40%). Under Scenario 2 (January 21 acquisition), the QIP receives permanent 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025, yielding $1,500,000 in first-year deductions ($1.5M × 100%). The difference is $900,000 ($1.5M × 60% differential). At a 37% combined federal/state tax rate, this represents approximately $333,000 in tax savings simply by waiting 3 days to close. This dramatic example illustrates the critical importance of understanding legislative cutoff dates in real estate tax planning. Strategic timing around the January 19, 2025 OBBBA effective date can generate enormous value, particularly for properties with substantial QIP components. Cost segregation professionals and tax advisors must proactively counsel clients on these timing considerations during acquisition negotiations.

## Question 9
A tax advisor is working with a client who owns multiple commercial properties and is planning significant interior improvement projects throughout 2025-2027. The client asks whether they should consider electing out of bonus depreciation for QIP to preserve deductions for future years when they expect higher income. How should the advisor analyze this decision considering QIP's 15-year recovery period, the permanence of 100% bonus under OBBBA 2025, and the interaction with other tax planning strategies?

A) Always elect out of bonus depreciation to spread deductions evenly and avoid "wasting" deductions in low-income years
B) Analyze the client's multi-year income projections, marginal tax rates, alternative minimum tax exposure, passive activity loss limitations, state conformity, and time value of money to determine optimal strategy on a property-by-property basis
C) Always take 100% bonus because permanent status means there's no future phase-down risk
D) Elect out of bonus only for properties acquired before OBBBA to preserve the 15-year recovery option

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the sophisticated, professional approach that tax advisors should employ. The decision to elect out of bonus depreciation for QIP is highly fact-specific and requires comprehensive analysis of multiple factors: (1) **Multi-year income projections** - will the client have higher taxable income in future years where deductions would be more valuable?; (2) **Marginal tax rates** - current vs. expected future rates, considering potential legislative changes; (3) **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** - bonus depreciation could trigger or increase AMT liability; (4) **Passive activity loss limitations** - for passive real estate investors, accelerated deductions may be suspended and unusable; (5) **State tax conformity** - some states don't conform to federal bonus depreciation, creating book-tax differences; (6) **Time value of money** - earlier deductions are generally more valuable, but this must be weighed against the other factors. The analysis should be done property-by-property because each investment may have different characteristics. While OBBBA's permanent 100% bonus eliminates phase-down risk, that doesn't mean taking bonus is always optimal. A blanket "always take" or "always elect out" approach fails to serve the client's best interests and could result in significant tax inefficiencies.

## Question 10
Congress is considering potential modifications to QIP rules as part of future tax reform discussions. A sophisticated real estate investor asks their cost segregation consultant to explain how changes to the QIP definition, recovery period, or bonus depreciation eligibility could impact their portfolio strategy for properties acquired in 2025-2030. What is the most comprehensive and professionally sound analysis?

A) QIP rules are now permanent under OBBBA so there's no legislative risk to consider in long-term planning
B) While OBBBA made 100% bonus permanent, Congress retains authority to modify QIP definitions, recovery periods, or bonus eligibility in future legislation; prudent planning should optimize under current law while maintaining flexibility for potential changes, including considering the value of cost segregation studies even if bonus rules change, monitoring legislative developments, and structuring acquisitions to preserve options
C) Assume QIP will be eliminated by 2028 and plan conservatively with only 39-year recovery
D) The investor should avoid all QIP-eligible improvements and focus only on 5-year and 7-year property to minimize legislative risk

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the most sophisticated and professionally sound analysis. While OBBBA 2025 labeled the 100% bonus depreciation as "permanent" (meaning no built-in sunset or phase-down schedule), Congress retains constitutional authority to modify any tax provision through future legislation. The term "permanent" simply means that affirmative Congressional action would be required to change the rules, rather than having automatic phase-downs occur. A prudent long-term strategy should: (1) **Optimize under current law** - take full advantage of permanent 100% bonus and 15-year QIP recovery while available; (2) **Maintain flexibility** - structure transactions and entity choices to preserve options if rules change; (3) **Recognize enduring value** - even if bonus depreciation were eliminated, QIP's 15-year recovery period (vs. 39 years) still provides substantial acceleration, making cost segregation studies valuable under multiple scenarios; (4) **Monitor developments** - track legislative proposals and adjust strategy as needed; (5) **Avoid over-optimization** - don't make business decisions solely based on current tax rules that could change. This balanced approach maximizes current tax benefits while remaining realistic about political and legislative dynamics, serving the client's long-term interests better than either naive assumptions of permanence or overly conservative planning that foregoes legitimate current benefits.
