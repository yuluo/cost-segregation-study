## Question 1
What is the primary difference between accelerated depreciation methods and the straight-line method?

A) Accelerated methods are only available for buildings, while straight-line is for personal property
B) Accelerated methods front-load deductions in early years, while straight-line spreads deductions evenly
C) Accelerated methods require longer recovery periods than straight-line
D) Accelerated methods can only be used with ADS, not GDS

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Accelerated depreciation methods front-load deductions in the early years of an asset's life, providing larger depreciation deductions initially that decrease over time. In contrast, the straight-line method spreads depreciation deductions evenly across the entire recovery period, providing the same deduction amount each year. This fundamental difference makes accelerated methods particularly valuable from a tax planning perspective because they maximize the time value of money by generating larger deductions sooner. Common accelerated methods under MACRS include the 200% declining balance method and the 150% declining balance method, which automatically switch to straight-line when it becomes more beneficial.

## Question 2
Which depreciation method provides the most rapid cost recovery in the early years and is typically used for 5, 7, and 10-year property?

A) 150% Declining Balance
B) Straight-Line Method
C) 200% Double Declining Balance (DDB)
D) Sum-of-the-Years-Digits Method

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The 200% Double Declining Balance (DDB) method provides the most rapid cost recovery in the early years and is the default depreciation method for 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year property under MACRS GDS. This method uses twice the straight-line rate (hence "200%") to calculate depreciation, resulting in much larger deductions in the first few years of an asset's life. The method automatically switches to straight-line depreciation when doing so produces a larger deduction than continuing with the declining balance calculation. This switch typically occurs in the later years of the recovery period and is built into the MACRS depreciation tables published by the IRS, making the calculation straightforward for taxpayers.

## Question 3
Which depreciation method is used for 15-year and 20-year property under MACRS GDS?

A) 200% Double Declining Balance
B) 150% Declining Balance
C) Straight-Line Method
D) 125% Declining Balance

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The 150% Declining Balance method is used for 15-year and 20-year property under MACRS GDS. This method uses 1.5 times the straight-line rate (150%) to calculate depreciation, providing moderate acceleration compared to the straight-line method but less aggressive than the 200% method used for shorter-lived assets. Like the 200% method, the 150% declining balance automatically switches to straight-line depreciation when doing so produces a larger deduction. This method is particularly relevant in cost segregation studies for land improvements (typically 15-year property), which represent a significant portion of reclassified assets. The 150% method strikes a balance between accelerated cost recovery and longer recovery periods.

## Question 4
A taxpayer purchases office equipment (7-year property) on July 1, 2025, for $100,000. Under MACRS GDS, which depreciation method will be used by default?

A) Straight-Line Method
B) 150% Declining Balance
C) 200% Double Declining Balance, automatically switching to straight-line when beneficial
D) Sum-of-the-Years-Digits Method

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Office equipment classified as 7-year property automatically uses the 200% Double Declining Balance method under MACRS GDS. This is the default method for 3-year, 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year property. The method provides accelerated depreciation in the early years and automatically switches to the straight-line method when doing so produces a larger deduction—typically in the later years of the recovery period. For the $100,000 of office equipment placed in service on July 1, 2025, the taxpayer would use the MACRS half-year convention (assuming it applies) and follow the IRS depreciation tables, which have this automatic switch built in. This accelerated recovery, combined with 100% bonus depreciation available under OBBBA 2025, could allow immediate expensing of the full amount in year one.

## Question 5
Which types of property are required to use the straight-line depreciation method under MACRS?

A) All personal property with recovery periods of 5 years or less
B) Real property with 27.5-year and 39-year recovery periods
C) Only property used predominantly outside the United States
D) Land improvements with 15-year recovery periods

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Real property with 27.5-year (residential rental) and 39-year (non-residential/commercial) recovery periods is required to use the straight-line depreciation method under MACRS. Unlike personal property, which can use accelerated methods like 200% or 150% declining balance, real property must spread its depreciation deductions evenly over the recovery period. While it's true that property used predominantly outside the United States must use ADS, which employs straight-line depreciation, that's a different requirement than the mandatory straight-line method for real property classifications. The straight-line requirement for real property is fundamental to MACRS and ensures that buildings are depreciated evenly, which is why cost segregation studies are so valuable—they reclassify components from the slow 27.5/39-year straight-line recovery to accelerated 5, 7, or 15-year recovery periods.

## Question 6
A taxpayer has been using the 200% declining balance method for their office furniture for two consecutive tax years. They now want to switch to the straight-line method. What must they do?

A) Simply begin using straight-line in the current year without any filing requirements
B) File Form 3115 (Application for Change in Accounting Method) because the method has become "established"
C) The switch happens automatically when beneficial, so no action is needed
D) File an amended return for the prior two years to establish straight-line from the beginning

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Once a taxpayer has used a depreciation method for two consecutive tax years, it becomes an "established" depreciation method under IRS rules. Changing from an established method requires filing Form 3115 (Application for Change in Accounting Method) to obtain IRS consent for the change. This is different from the automatic switch from declining balance to straight-line that occurs within the normal MACRS calculation—that automatic switch is built into the depreciation tables and doesn't require Form 3115. However, voluntarily electing to switch to straight-line before the automatic switch point, or changing methods after they've become established, does require Form 3115. This rule ensures proper tracking of depreciation methods and prevents taxpayers from arbitrarily switching methods to manipulate deductions year-to-year.

## Question 7
When does the 200% or 150% declining balance method automatically switch to the straight-line method under MACRS?

A) After exactly half of the recovery period has elapsed
B) When the straight-line method produces a larger deduction than continuing with the declining balance method
C) When the asset's book value drops below 50% of its original cost
D) Only when the taxpayer files Form 3115 to request the switch

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The automatic switch from declining balance to straight-line occurs when the straight-line method calculated on the remaining basis produces a larger deduction than continuing with the declining balance method. This switch is mathematically determined and built into the MACRS depreciation tables published by the IRS, so taxpayers using the tables don't need to perform the calculation themselves—it happens automatically. The switch typically occurs in the later years of the recovery period when the declining balance method's deductions have diminished to the point where the straight-line method becomes more favorable. This automatic optimization ensures taxpayers always receive the maximum allowable depreciation deduction without needing to track when the crossover point occurs or file any forms to make the switch.

## Question 8
A cost segregation consultant is analyzing a commercial building and has identified components that could be classified as either 7-year property (using 200% DDB) or 15-year land improvements (using 150% DB). Both classifications are technically supportable. How should the consultant approach this decision, considering depreciation methods, bonus depreciation eligibility, and professional standards?

A) Always choose 7-year property because the 200% method provides faster deductions than the 150% method
B) Choose 15-year property because land improvements are easier to defend in an IRS audit
C) Analyze the specific facts and circumstances, considering asset function, industry standards, and supportable classification under Revenue Procedure 87-56, while ensuring both classifications qualify for 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025
D) Split the difference and classify as 10-year property to be conservative

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This is the professional and technically correct approach. While both 7-year (200% DDB) and 15-year (150% DB) property may seem attractive because they both qualify for 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 (recovery periods of 20 years or less), the consultant's primary obligation is to supportable, fact-based classification according to Revenue Procedure 87-56 and professional standards (such as ASCSP guidelines). The classification must be based on the specific facts and circumstances of each component—its function, permanence, and actual use—rather than simply choosing the most aggressive classification. While the 200% DDB method for 7-year property does provide faster cost recovery than 150% DB for 15-year property in the absence of bonus depreciation, the current availability of 100% bonus actually makes both classifications result in immediate full expensing. The key is that proper classification protects the study's credibility and defendability in an IRS audit, which is more important than marginal differences in depreciation methods.

## Question 9
Consider how the availability of 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 fundamentally changes the practical importance of choosing between different MACRS depreciation methods (200% DDB vs. 150% DB vs. straight-line) for qualifying property. How should this shift affect cost segregation strategy and analysis?

A) Depreciation methods no longer matter at all since 100% bonus eliminates all first-year differences
B) Depreciation methods remain critically important for the remaining basis after bonus depreciation is claimed
C) The focus should shift from depreciation method selection to ensuring proper asset classification and recovery period determination, since all qualifying property (5, 7, 15-year) receives 100% first-year expensing regardless of method
D) Only straight-line method should be used going forward to simplify tax preparation

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This is the sophisticated understanding of how OBBBA 2025's permanent 100% bonus depreciation fundamentally shifts cost segregation strategy. When qualifying property receives 100% bonus depreciation in year one, the depreciation method (whether 200% DDB, 150% DB, or straight-line) becomes functionally irrelevant for the first-year tax benefit—all qualifying property is fully expensed immediately regardless of which method would have been used. This means the critical focus shifts to proper asset classification and recovery period determination to ensure the asset qualifies for the 20-years-or-less threshold that triggers bonus eligibility. A component correctly classified as 15-year land improvement (using 150% DB) receives the same 100% first-year deduction as a component classified as 7-year property (using 200% DDB). The depreciation method only matters if: (1) the taxpayer elects out of bonus depreciation, or (2) for the building structure itself (39-year), which doesn't qualify for bonus. This paradigm shift means cost segregation professionals should prioritize defensible classification over method optimization.

## Question 10
A taxpayer argues that because 100% bonus depreciation is now permanent under OBBBA 2025, they should be able to voluntarily elect the straight-line method for their 5-year and 7-year property to "simplify" their depreciation tracking, since they'll expense everything immediately anyway via bonus depreciation. From a technical tax compliance and future planning perspective, is this a sound strategy, and what potential issues might arise?

A) This is a sound strategy because the method choice doesn't affect the first-year deduction with 100% bonus
B) This strategy has risks: if bonus depreciation is repealed or the taxpayer later elects out of bonus, the straight-line election is irrevocable and they'd be locked into slower depreciation; additionally, once established, changing methods requires Form 3115
C) This strategy is required by the IRS when claiming 100% bonus depreciation
D) This strategy is ideal because straight-line is always preferable for tax planning purposes

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the sophisticated risk analysis that professional tax advisors should consider. While electing straight-line for 5-year and 7-year property doesn't affect the current-year tax outcome when 100% bonus applies, it creates significant future risks. Depreciation method elections are typically irrevocable, and once a method has been used for two consecutive years, it becomes "established" and requires Form 3115 to change. If bonus depreciation is later repealed by Congress (despite being labeled "permanent," tax laws can always change) or if the taxpayer elects out of bonus for any reason, they would be locked into the much slower straight-line method instead of the accelerated 200% DDB they would have had by default. For a $1 million asset with a 7-year recovery period, this could mean tens of thousands of dollars in lost time-value-of-money benefits over the recovery period. The prudent approach is to use the default accelerated methods, which preserve flexibility and optimal deductions if circumstances change while still allowing 100% bonus currently.
