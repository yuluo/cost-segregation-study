## Question 1
How is the partial disposition election made for a MACRS asset?

A) By filing Form 3115 (Application for Change in Accounting Method)
B) By filing a special election statement with the IRS
C) By reporting the gain or loss on a timely filed return for the year of disposition
D) By filing Form 8824 (Like-Kind Exchanges)

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: According to Reg. §1.168(i)-8(d)(2), the partial disposition election is made by reporting the gain or loss on a **timely filed original tax return, including extensions**, for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs. No special form or separate election statement is required - you simply report the disposition on Form 4797 with the words "Partial Disposition Election" in the asset description. This makes it straightforward for taxpayers to elect partial disposition treatment.

## Question 2
Which of the following is an example of a partial disposition?

A) Selling an entire building to a third party
B) Replacing an old roof with a new roof on a building you still own
C) Trading one property for another in a like-kind exchange
D) Abandoning an entire rental property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: A partial disposition occurs when a taxpayer disposes of a **portion** of an asset while retaining the overall asset. Replacing an old roof with a new roof is a classic example - you're disposing of a component (the old roof) of the building, but you still own the building itself. Other examples include replacing HVAC systems, elevators, or tenant improvements. Options A, C, and D all involve disposing of the entire property, not just a portion, so they would be full dispositions, not partial dispositions.

## Question 3
What is the primary tax benefit of making a partial disposition election?

A) It allows you to defer all taxes until the building is sold
B) It allows you to recognize a loss on the retired component's remaining basis
C) It eliminates the need to capitalize the replacement component
D) It converts ordinary income into capital gains

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The primary tax benefit of the partial disposition election is that it allows you to **recognize a loss on the retired component's remaining basis** (the undepreciated portion) in the year of retirement. For example, if you replace a roof that still has $50,000 of undepreciated basis, you can deduct that $50,000 loss immediately rather than continuing to depreciate it over the remaining life. This provides an immediate tax benefit. Note that the replacement component must still be capitalized - the election doesn't change capitalization requirements for the new asset.

## Question 4
A building owner replaces a 15-year-old HVAC system that originally cost $100,000 and has $40,000 of remaining basis. They spend $150,000 on the new HVAC system. If they make the partial disposition election, what are the immediate tax consequences?

A) $40,000 loss deduction; capitalize the $150,000 replacement
B) $100,000 loss deduction; capitalize the $150,000 replacement
C) No loss deduction; capitalize $150,000 minus $40,000 = $110,000
D) $40,000 loss deduction; expense the $150,000 under Section 179

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: When making a partial disposition election, the taxpayer can deduct the **$40,000 remaining basis** (undepreciated amount) of the old HVAC system as a loss in the current year. The **$150,000 replacement cost** must be **capitalized** as a new asset and depreciated over its recovery period. The election doesn't change the capitalization requirements for the replacement - it only allows you to recognize the loss on the retired component. The $100,000 original cost is irrelevant since $60,000 has already been depreciated. While Section 179 might be available for the replacement, that's a separate election independent of the partial disposition treatment.

## Question 5
A taxpayer demolished part of a building in 2024 but didn't make a partial disposition election on their 2024 return. Can they still make the election?

A) No, the election must be made on the original return for the year of disposition
B) Yes, but only if they file an amended return within 3 years
C) Yes, they can make it on an amended return subject to statute of limitations
D) Yes, but they must file Form 3115 for a change in accounting method

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: According to IRS regulations and the study material, the partial disposition election can be **made on an amended return for prior years, subject to statute of limitations**. While the election must ideally be made on a timely filed original return (including extensions), taxpayers who missed the election can still make it on an amended return if within the applicable statute of limitations period (generally 3 years from the original filing date or 2 years from when tax was paid).

Form 3115 (Application for Change in Accounting Method) is generally **not required** for making a partial disposition election, even retroactively. The election is made by simply reporting the disposition on the amended return with the appropriate gain/loss calculation on Form 4797. However, the amended return must be filed within the statute of limitations period, and there may be other procedural requirements.

## Question 6
On which form should the partial disposition be reported?

A) Form 4562 (Depreciation and Amortization)
B) Form 4797 (Sales of Business Property)
C) Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses)
D) Form 8824 (Like-Kind Exchanges)

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Partial dispositions must be reported on **Form 4797 (Sales of Business Property)**, Part I, II, or III, as applicable. According to IRS instructions, when reporting a partial disposition election, you should include the words **"Partial Disposition Election"** in the description of the partially disposed asset. This makes it clear to the IRS that you're making the election. Form 4562 is for depreciation but not for reporting dispositions, Schedule D is for personal capital gains/losses, and Form 8824 is specifically for like-kind exchanges (which are now limited to real property).

## Question 7
A landlord removes old carpet (basis: $15,000) and installs new carpet for $25,000 during a tenant turnover. The old carpet qualifies for partial disposition. What documentation should they maintain?

A) Only the invoice for the new carpet
B) Only the depreciation schedule showing the old carpet's basis
C) Documentation supporting the retirement (removal costs, invoices, photos) and the remaining basis
D) No documentation is required since it's under $25,000

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: According to the tangible property regulations and IRS guidance, taxpayers must **maintain thorough documentation supporting the retirement**. This includes:
- **Removal/demolition costs** and invoices showing the work was performed
- **Photographs** or other evidence of the removal
- **Depreciation schedules** showing the retired component's original cost and remaining basis
- **Invoices** for both the removal and the replacement

The study material specifically states: "Must maintain documentation supporting the retirement." This documentation is critical if the IRS examines the return, as you need to prove that the component was actually retired and properly valued. Simply having the new carpet invoice (A) or just the depreciation schedule (B) is insufficient, and option D is incorrect - documentation requirements apply regardless of dollar amounts.

## Question 8
A commercial building owner is planning a major renovation that will replace the roof ($200,000 basis remaining), HVAC ($150,000 basis remaining), and elevators ($100,000 basis remaining). They're considering whether to make partial disposition elections. How should this interact with their cost segregation study strategy?

A) Cost segregation is unnecessary if making partial disposition elections
B) The cost segregation study should identify specific components to facilitate calculating remaining basis for each retirement
C) Partial dispositions eliminate the need to capitalize replacement components
D) Cost segregation and partial dispositions cannot be used together

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This demonstrates excellent understanding of how cost segregation and partial dispositions work together strategically! A **cost segregation study identifies and values specific building components**, which is invaluable when making partial disposition elections. Without a cost segregation study, it can be difficult to determine what portion of the building's basis belongs to the roof, HVAC, or elevators that are being replaced.

The study material emphasizes: **"Coordinate with cost segregation studies"** as a key strategic consideration. Here's why this matters:
- The cost seg study allocates the original building cost to specific components
- This allocation provides the starting basis for calculating remaining (undepreciated) basis
- When you retire a component, you know exactly what basis to write off

Options A, C, and D are incorrect:
- Cost segregation remains valuable (not unnecessary)
- Replacement components must still be capitalized (the election doesn't change this)
- The two strategies complement each other and are often used together

## Question 9
A taxpayer did a cost segregation study in 2020 that identified a roof with $300,000 allocated cost (15-year property). In 2026, they replace the roof when it has $100,000 remaining basis. They elect partial disposition and capitalize the $400,000 replacement roof. Considering the phase-out of bonus depreciation, what is the optimal tax strategy?

A) Don't make the partial disposition election to avoid the $100,000 loss
B) Make the partial disposition election for the $100,000 loss; the replacement gets current bonus depreciation rates
C) Defer the replacement until 2027 when bonus is 0% to maximize the partial disposition loss benefit
D) Make the election but treat the replacement as a repair to avoid capitalization

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This demonstrates sophisticated tax planning in the context of bonus depreciation phase-out! The optimal strategy is to **make the partial disposition election** for the immediate $100,000 loss deduction, while the **$400,000 replacement roof gets the current year's bonus depreciation** rate (20% in 2026 under pre-OBBBA law, though OBBBA 2025 changed this to 100% for qualifying property).

Here's the analysis:
- **2026 tax benefit**: $100,000 loss + ($400,000 × 20% bonus) = $100,000 + $80,000 = **$180,000 first-year deduction**
- Option C (deferring to 2027) would only give: $100,000 loss + regular depreciation (no bonus) = **worse result**
- Option A (no election) loses the $100,000 immediate benefit
- Option D is wrong - roof replacements must be capitalized under the BAR tests

**Key insight**: Partial disposition elections become **more valuable** as bonus phases out because the immediate loss recognition provides a deduction that would otherwise be stretched over many years. The replacement still gets whatever bonus rate applies in the year it's placed in service.

## Question 10
A real estate developer is comparing two properties for renovation: Property A has good cost segregation documentation identifying all components and their allocated costs, while Property B has no cost segregation study. Both need major component replacements. How does this affect their ability to utilize partial disposition elections?

A) Both properties can equally benefit from partial dispositions using estimated percentages
B) Property A can make precise partial disposition elections with documented basis; Property B may struggle to support the component basis and face IRS challenges
C) Property B has an advantage because they can estimate higher basis amounts for larger losses
D) Partial dispositions are only available for properties with formal cost segregation studies

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This perfectly illustrates why cost segregation studies and partial dispositions are complementary strategies! **Property A has a significant advantage** because:

**Property A (with cost segregation documentation):**
- Has **documented, allocated costs** for each building component
- Can make **precise partial disposition elections** with clear basis calculations
- Has **strong IRS audit defense** with professional documentation
- Can **maximize tax benefits** with accurate component basis

**Property B (without cost segregation):**
- Must use **reasonable allocation methods** (like Producer Price Index per Reg. §1.168(i)-8(f)(3))
- **Harder to support** component basis in an IRS examination
- **Higher audit risk** - IRS may challenge the allocation methodology
- May **forfeit benefits** rather than risk uncertain positions

The study material emphasizes: **"Coordinate with cost segregation studies"** and **"Document retirements thoroughly"** as strategic considerations. While partial dispositions are technically available without a cost segregation study (so D is wrong), Property A's documentation makes the strategy far more effective and defensible.
