## Question 1
What is the MACRS recovery period for computers and office equipment used in a cost segregation study?

A) 3 years
B) 5 years
C) 7 years
D) 10 years

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under MACRS, computers and office equipment are classified as 5-year property. This is distinct from office furniture and fixtures, which are 7-year property. The 5-year classification also includes automobiles and appliances, making these common targets for cost segregation reclassification from 39-year building property.

## Question 2
Under MACRS GDS, what depreciation method is used for 15-year land improvements such as parking lots?

A) Straight-line
B) 150% declining balance
C) 200% declining balance
D) Units of production

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under MACRS GDS, 15-year land improvements (parking lots, sidewalks, landscaping, fences) use the 150% declining balance method. This is slower than the 200% declining balance used for 5-year and 7-year personal property, but faster than the straight-line method required for 27.5-year and 39-year real property.

## Question 3
Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) refers to interior improvements made to a nonresidential building after it was first placed in service. What is the MACRS GDS recovery period for QIP?

A) 7 years
B) 10 years
C) 15 years
D) 39 years

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) is classified as 15-year property under MACRS GDS, not 7-year. QIP includes interior improvements such as interior walls, lighting, flooring, and HVAC modifications made to nonresidential buildings after they were first placed in service. As 15-year property, QIP qualifies for bonus depreciation (20% in 2026). Under ADS, QIP has a 20-year recovery period. This is a critical distinction for cost segregation practitioners.

## Question 4
A taxpayer places $600,000 of equipment in service in March 2026, $200,000 in June 2026, and $400,000 in November 2026. Total property placed in service is $1,200,000. Which depreciation convention applies?

A) Half-year convention, because most property was placed in service before Q4
B) Mid-quarter convention, because more than 40% ($400K/$1,200K = 33.3%) was placed in Q4
C) Half-year convention, because the Q4 property is less than 40% of the total
D) Mid-month convention for all personal property

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The mid-quarter convention only applies when MORE than 40% of the total depreciable basis of personal property is placed in service in the last quarter (Q4: October, November, December). Here, only $400,000 of $1,200,000 (33.3%) was placed in Q4, which does NOT exceed the 40% threshold. Therefore, the half-year convention applies to all the equipment. Note: Mid-month convention only applies to real property (27.5 and 39-year), never to personal property like equipment.

## Question 5
A taxpayer acquires a building and conducts a cost segregation study that identifies decorative wall coverings specific to a retail tenant space. The tenant has a 5-year lease. How should these wall coverings be classified?

A) 39-year real property, because they are attached to the building
B) 7-year property, as they are tenant-specific fixtures
C) 15-year property, as they are qualified improvement property
D) 5-year property, matching the lease term

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Decorative wall coverings specific to a tenant space are classified as tenant-specific fixtures, which are 7-year property under MACRS. They are not structural components of the building because they serve a specific tenant space rather than the building as a whole. While they could potentially be QIP (15-year) if installed after the building was placed in service, the more precise classification for decorative finishes and fixtures specific to tenant spaces is typically 7-year property. The lease term does not determine the MACRS recovery period.

## Question 6
A taxpayer places $300,000 in equipment in January 2026, $200,000 in May 2026, and $600,000 in October 2026. What is the total basis placed in Q4, and which convention applies?

A) $600K in Q4; 54.5% exceeds 40%, so mid-quarter convention applies
B) $600K in Q4; 54.5% does not exceed 50%, so half-year convention applies
C) $600K in Q4; exactly 40%, so half-year convention applies
D) $800K in Q4; 72.7% exceeds 40%, so mid-quarter convention applies

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: Total property placed in service is $1,100,000 ($300K + $200K + $600K). Q4 consists of October, November, and December. The October placement of $600,000 represents 54.5% of the total basis ($600K/$1,100K = 54.5%). Since this exceeds the 40% threshold, the mid-quarter convention must be used for all personal property placed in service during the year. This is a critical calculation for tax practitioners to determine the correct depreciation convention.

## Question 7
A building owner installs new interior improvements in 2026: HVAC ductwork modifications ($100K), interior partition walls ($200K), and new flooring ($150K). The building was originally placed in service in 2022. Assuming these qualify as QIP, what is the correct tax treatment in 2026?

A) 39-year property using straight-line, no bonus depreciation
B) 15-year property using 150% declining balance, eligible for 20% bonus depreciation
C) 15-year property using straight-line under ADS, no bonus depreciation
D) 7-year property using 200% declining balance, eligible for 20% bonus depreciation

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: These interior improvements made after the building was first placed in service (2022) qualify as Qualified Improvement Property (QIP). QIP is classified as 15-year property under MACRS GDS and uses the 150% declining balance method. For property placed in service in 2026, QIP is eligible for 20% bonus depreciation (the rate has been phasing down: 60% in 2024, 40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, and 0% in 2027+). This provides significant tax benefits through both accelerated depreciation and the remaining bonus percentage.

## Question 8
A taxpayer operates a business and in 2026 places the following in service: $200K equipment in February, $300K equipment in July, $500K equipment in November, and $400K equipment in December. They also acquire a $2M building in September. What convention applies to each category?

A) Half-year for all equipment and building; the building basis doesn't affect the 40% test
B) Mid-quarter for equipment (90% in Q4); mid-month for building
C) Half-year for equipment (buildings are excluded from the 40% test); mid-month for building
D) Mid-quarter for all assets including the building

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: For the mid-quarter convention test, real property (the building) is EXCLUDED from the calculation. Only personal property (equipment) is considered. Equipment placed in Q4: $500K (Nov) + $400K (Dec) = $900K out of $1,400K total equipment = 64.3% in Q4. Since this exceeds 40%, the mid-quarter convention applies to all equipment. The building, as 39-year real property, always uses the mid-month convention regardless of when it's acquired or the equipment placement timing. These are independent determinations.

## Question 9
A taxpayer's depreciation method becomes "established" after using it for two consecutive tax returns. They depreciated a building as 39-year property in 2024 and 2025. In 2026, they want to perform cost segregation. They also acquired QIP improvements in 2026. What is required?

A) File Form 3115 for the building components being reclassified; the 2026 QIP can be classified as 15-year without Form 3115
B) File Form 3115 for both the building and the QIP
C) No Form 3115 needed; cost segregation can proceed normally for both
D) Cost segregation cannot be performed once the method is established

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: The Two Consecutive Year Rule applies to the building, which was depreciated as 39-year property in both 2024 and 2025. To reclassify building components through cost segregation, Form 3115 (change in accounting method) must be filed. However, the QIP improvements acquired in 2026 are NEW assets being placed in service for the first time - there is no "established" depreciation method for them yet. The taxpayer can properly classify the 2026 QIP as 15-year property from the start without needing Form 3115. This distinction is critical: Form 3115 is only needed when CHANGING an established method, not when correctly classifying new property.

## Question 10
A cost segregation study for a 2026 acquisition identifies: $800K of 5-year property, $400K of 15-year QIP, and $200K of 15-year land improvements. The client asks whether to implement the study now or wait until 2027. What is the key tax consideration?

A) Wait until 2027 when bonus depreciation expires to spread deductions more evenly
B) Implement now to capture 20% bonus depreciation on eligible property; waiting until 2027 loses bonus entirely
C) QIP and land improvements never qualify for bonus, so timing doesn't matter
D) Implement now because the Two Consecutive Year Rule requires immediate classification

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: The critical tax consideration is bonus depreciation timing. In 2026, eligible property qualifies for 20% bonus depreciation. Starting in 2027, bonus depreciation drops to 0% (it has been phasing down: 80% in 2023, 60% in 2024, 40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, 0% in 2027+). If they implement the study in 2026, the $800K of 5-year property and potentially the QIP can receive 20% bonus depreciation. Waiting until 2027 means losing this benefit entirely, though they still get accelerated depreciation. The Two Consecutive Year Rule relates to changing established methods, not timing of initial classification.
