## Question 1
What is the primary function of bonus depreciation as a tax provision?

A) It replaces the regular MACRS depreciation system entirely for qualifying assets
B) It allows immediate first-year expensing of a percentage of an asset's cost, taken in addition to regular depreciation
C) It extends the recovery period for assets to reduce annual depreciation amounts
D) It applies only to real property such as commercial buildings

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Bonus depreciation allows immediate first-year expensing of a percentage (now permanently 100% under OBBBA 2025) of an asset's cost. This is taken as an additional deduction on top of regular MACRS depreciation, not as a replacement for it. The remaining basis after bonus depreciation is then depreciated using the standard MACRS method over the asset's recovery period.

## Question 2
Which recovery period threshold determines whether property generally qualifies for bonus depreciation?

A) Property with recovery periods of 10 years or less
B) Property with recovery periods of 20 years or less
C) Property with recovery periods of 27.5 years or less
D) All property regardless of recovery period

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Bonus depreciation generally applies to property with recovery periods of 20 years or less. This includes 5-year property (equipment, computers, vehicles), 7-year property (furniture, fixtures, office equipment), and 15-year property (land improvements, qualified improvement property). Real property with longer recovery periods—such as residential rental property (27.5 years) and commercial buildings (39 years)—does not qualify for bonus depreciation.

## Question 3
A company signs a binding contract to purchase manufacturing equipment on January 15, 2025, with delivery and placement in service scheduled for March 1, 2025. What bonus depreciation rate applies to this equipment?

A) 100% because it was placed in service after January 19, 2025
B) 40% because the binding contract was signed before January 19, 2025
C) 60% carried over from the 2024 rate
D) 100% with no restrictions since it's manufacturing equipment

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: The critical date for OBBBA bonus depreciation is the **acquisition date**, which is determined by when the binding contract was signed, not when the property is placed in service. Since the binding contract was signed on January 15, 2025 (before the January 19, 2025 OBBBA cutoff), this equipment only qualifies for the 40% bonus depreciation rate that was in effect under the phase-down schedule. Even though the equipment was delivered and placed in service after January 19, 2025, the earlier binding contract date controls. For property to qualify for the permanent 100% bonus under OBBBA, the binding contract must be signed after January 19, 2025.

## Question 4
A real estate investor purchases a commercial building on February 10, 2025, and places it in service on March 1, 2025. A cost segregation study identifies $1.5 million in 5-year and 7-year property components. What bonus depreciation rate applies to the identified personal property?

A) 0% because commercial buildings don't qualify for bonus depreciation
B) 40% because commercial real estate has special rules
C) 100% because the property was acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025
D) 60% based on when the building construction was completed

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Since the commercial building was acquired (purchased) on February 10, 2025, which is after the January 19, 2025 OBBBA cutoff date, the personal property components identified through cost segregation qualify for the permanent 100% bonus depreciation. While the building structure itself (39-year property) doesn't qualify for bonus depreciation, the 5-year and 7-year property components have recovery periods of 20 years or less and therefore qualify. The $1.5 million in identified personal property receives 100% first-year bonus depreciation, providing substantial immediate tax benefits. This demonstrates the powerful combination of cost segregation studies with the restored 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA.

## Question 5
A business owner acquired a building on December 15, 2024, and conducts a cost segregation study in April 2025 that identifies $800,000 in qualifying 5-year and 7-year property. What bonus depreciation rate applies to the reclassified property?

A) 100% because the cost segregation study was completed after January 19, 2025
B) 60% because the building was acquired in 2024
C) 40% because the study was filed in 2025
D) 100% because all cost segregation studies now qualify for the permanent rate

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: When a cost segregation study is performed on an existing building, the reclassified property components (5-year and 7-year assets) are treated as having been placed in service on the same date as the building itself, not when the study is completed. Since the building was acquired and placed in service on December 15, 2024, the reclassified property qualifies for the 2024 bonus depreciation rate of 60%. The timing of the cost segregation study completion (April 2025) does not change the placed-in-service date. The catch-up depreciation from prior years is captured through a §481(a) adjustment when filing Form 3115 (Application for Change in Accounting Method), but the applicable bonus rate is locked in based on the original 2024 acquisition date.

## Question 6
A construction company begins building a warehouse on January 10, 2025. By January 19, 2025, they have completed 12% of the total construction costs. The warehouse is completed and placed in service on May 1, 2025. Under the 10% construction rule, what bonus depreciation rate likely applies to qualifying property in this warehouse?

A) 100% because the warehouse was placed in service after January 19, 2025
B) 40% because more than 10% was completed before January 19, 2025
C) 0% because the construction started before January 19, 2025
D) 60% as a blended rate between the two periods

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: The 10% construction rule is a critical timing provision for determining bonus depreciation eligibility. Under this rule, if at least 10% of a building or construction project's total cost was completed before the critical cutoff date (January 19, 2025), the entire project is treated as acquired before that date and only qualifies for the earlier bonus depreciation schedule. In this case, 12% of the warehouse was completed by January 19, 2025, triggering the 10% rule. Therefore, the entire warehouse—including all qualifying 5-year, 7-year, and 15-year property identified through cost segregation—only qualifies for the 40% bonus rate that was in effect before the OBBBA cutoff, even though the warehouse wasn't placed in service until May 1, 2025. This rule prevents taxpayers from benefiting from improved bonus rates for projects substantially underway before the effective date.

## Question 7
A taxpayer is negotiating to purchase equipment in mid-January 2025. They can either sign the contract on January 18, 2025, with delivery in March, or delay signing until January 21, 2025, with delivery in April. The equipment costs $500,000 with a 7-year recovery period. What is the first-year tax benefit difference between these two timing options?

A) $100,000 (difference between 60% and 100% bonus)
B) $300,000 (difference between 40% and 100% bonus)
C) $0 (both qualify for the same rate since delivery is after January 19)
D) $200,000 (difference between 60% bonus in January vs 100% in April)

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The timing difference of just 3 days creates a massive $300,000 first-year tax benefit difference. Signing on January 18, 2025 (before the OBBBA cutoff) means the equipment qualifies for only 40% bonus depreciation under the phase-down schedule, providing a $200,000 first-year deduction ($500,000 × 40%). Signing on January 21, 2025 (after January 19) means the equipment qualifies for the permanent 100% bonus depreciation, providing a $500,000 first-year deduction ($500,000 × 100%). The difference is $300,000 in first-year deductions. This demonstrates why the January 19, 2025 date is so critical—the binding contract date controls eligibility, not the delivery or placed-in-service date. Strategic timing around this cutoff date can have enormous tax implications for businesses making capital investments.

## Question 8
A real estate development firm is planning to acquire and renovate 5 commercial buildings over the next 18 months. Buildings acquired in early 2025 (before January 19) qualify for 40% bonus, while those acquired after January 19, 2025 qualify for 100% permanent bonus. How should they structure their acquisition timeline and cost segregation strategy to optimize tax benefits while balancing cash flow needs?

A) Accelerate all acquisitions before January 19, 2025 to lock in the 40% rate before it phases down further
B) Delay all acquisitions until after January 19, 2025 to capture 100% bonus, and prioritize cost segregation studies immediately upon acquisition
C) Acquire buildings evenly throughout the period since the rates will average out over time
D) Focus only on Section 179 expensing and ignore bonus depreciation timing

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Delaying acquisitions until after January 19, 2025 maximizes tax benefits by capturing the permanent 100% bonus depreciation rather than the 40% rate available before that date. For each building, a cost segregation study should be conducted immediately upon acquisition to identify 5-year, 7-year, and 15-year property that qualifies for 100% first-year bonus depreciation. This strategy provides substantially greater first-year deductions (100% vs 40% on identified personal property, often 20-40% of building cost) and the permanent nature of the 100% bonus means there's no pressure to rush acquisitions—the firm can pace them according to operational needs and cash flow over the 18-month period. This represents optimal tax planning: maximizing deductions while maintaining strategic flexibility. The difference in tax benefit between 40% and 100% bonus on millions in personal property could fund additional acquisitions or renovations.

## Question 9
An accounting firm advises a manufacturing client who purchased a facility on January 10, 2025 (before OBBBA) and another facility on February 5, 2025 (after OBBBA). Both are conducting cost segregation studies now. How should the firm explain the differential bonus depreciation treatment and what documentation should they emphasize for IRS audit defense?

A) Both facilities receive 100% bonus since the studies are being done after OBBBA passed
B) The January 10 facility gets 40% bonus and the February 5 facility gets 100% bonus; emphasize acquisition dates, binding contracts, and placed-in-service documentation
C) Both facilities receive 40% bonus based on when construction permits were issued
D) The facilities should be combined into one study to average the rates

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The two facilities receive different bonus depreciation rates based on their acquisition dates relative to the January 19, 2025 OBBBA cutoff. The January 10 facility qualifies for 40% bonus depreciation on personal property identified through cost segregation, while the February 5 facility qualifies for 100% permanent bonus. The timing of the cost segregation studies (both conducted now) is irrelevant—what matters is when each facility was originally acquired and placed in service. For IRS audit defense, the accounting firm should emphasize maintaining comprehensive documentation including: (1) purchase agreements showing acquisition dates, (2) binding contract dates and terms, (3) closing documents, (4) placed-in-service dates with supporting evidence, and (5) detailed cost segregation reports clearly showing the placed-in-service dates for the identified property. This documentation trail proves which bonus rate applies to each facility and protects against IRS challenges.

## Question 10
Congress is considering future legislation that might modify bonus depreciation. A CFO asks their tax advisor how the "permanent" nature of OBBBA's 100% bonus affects their 10-year capital investment strategy, given the risk of future legislative changes. What is the most sophisticated analysis of this situation?

A) The permanent status means Congress cannot change it, so plan with complete certainty
B) While labeled "permanent," Congress can modify any tax provision; however, the lack of sunset provisions removes automatic phase-downs, reducing legislative risk and enabling longer-term planning compared to the previous regime
C) The permanent status is meaningless since all tax law changes annually
D) Companies should assume bonus depreciation will be eliminated by 2027 and plan accordingly

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the most sophisticated and realistic understanding of "permanent" tax provisions. While OBBBA's 100% bonus depreciation is labeled permanent (meaning it has no built-in sunset provisions or phase-down schedule), Congress retains the constitutional authority to modify any tax law at any time through future legislation. However, the practical value is substantial: the lack of automatic phase-downs means businesses can plan capital investments without the artificial pressure of declining rates forcing rushed decisions. Unlike the previous regime (where bonus dropped from 100% to 80% to 60% to 40% on a fixed schedule), the current law requires affirmative Congressional action to change the rate. This significantly reduces legislative risk and enables more confident 10-year capital planning. Smart CFOs should plan based on current law while monitoring legislative developments—a balanced approach that maximizes benefits without ignoring political reality.
