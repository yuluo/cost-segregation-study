## Question 1
The Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) was introduced by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In what year did MACRS first apply to assets placed in service?

A) 1986
B) 1987
C) 1988
D) 1990

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: MACRS was enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 but applies to all assets placed in service on or after January 1, 1987. This replaced the earlier Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) which was used from 1981-1986.

## Question 2
Under MACRS GDS, what depreciation method is applied to 5-year personal property such as computers and appliances?

A) Straight-line method
B) 150% declining balance
C) 200% declining balance
D) Sum-of-the-years-digits

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Under MACRS GDS, 5-year personal property (computers, appliances, office equipment) uses the 200% declining balance method. Similarly, 7-year property also uses 200% DB. In contrast, 15-year land improvements use 150% declining balance, and real property (27.5 and 39-year) uses straight-line depreciation.

## Question 3
A restaurant owner conducts a cost segregation study on their newly acquired building. The study identifies: (1) walk-in freezers, (2) decorative lighting fixtures specific to the dining area, (3) the building's central HVAC system, and (4) parking lot paving. Which items can be reclassified to shorter recovery periods?

A) Walk-in freezers (5-year), decorative lighting (7-year), and parking lot (15-year) — but NOT the central HVAC
B) All four items can be reclassified to 5-year property
C) Only the walk-in freezers and parking lot
D) Only the parking lot, as it is the only land improvement

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: Walk-in freezers are appliances (5-year property), decorative lighting fixtures are fixtures (7-year property), and parking lot paving is a land improvement (15-year property). However, the central HVAC system that serves the entire building is a structural component and remains 39-year real property. Only HVAC components serving specific tenant spaces or specific areas (not the whole building) can potentially be reclassified.

## Question 4
A property owner purchases a mixed-use building on March 10, 2026, where 85% of gross rental revenue comes from residential apartments and 15% comes from ground-floor retail. What is the correct MACRS classification and depreciation convention?

A) 39-year nonresidential property, mid-month convention starting March 15th
B) 27.5-year residential rental property, mid-month convention starting March 15th
C) Mixed classification: 85% as 27.5-year and 15% as 39-year, both using mid-month convention
D) 27.5-year residential rental property, half-year convention

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Since 85% of gross rental revenue comes from residential dwelling units (exceeding the 80% threshold), the entire building qualifies as 27.5-year residential rental property under MACRS. Real property (both residential and nonresidential) uses the mid-month convention, which treats the property as placed in service at the midpoint of the acquisition month (March 15th in this case), regardless of the actual purchase date.

## Question 5
A taxpayer places $800,000 of 7-year equipment in service in November 2026 and $150,000 of office computers in December 2026. Total MACRS property placed in service for the year is $950,000. Which depreciation convention applies to these assets?

A) Half-year convention for all assets
B) Mid-quarter convention for all assets, because more than 40% was placed in service in Q4
C) Half-year for November equipment, mid-quarter for December equipment
D) Mid-month convention for all personal property

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: The mid-quarter convention must be used when more than 40% of the total depreciable basis of MACRS property (excluding real property) is placed in service during the last 3 months of the tax year. Here, $950,000 of the total $950,000 (100%) was placed in service in Q4 (November and December), far exceeding the 40% threshold. The mid-quarter convention applies to all the assets. Note: Mid-month convention only applies to real property (27.5 and 39-year), not personal property like equipment and computers.

## Question 6
A taxpayer purchased a commercial office building in 2023 and depreciated it as 39-year property using straight-line on their 2023 and 2024 tax returns. In 2026, they want to perform a cost segregation study to reclassify components to shorter lives. What is the correct approach under the Two Consecutive Year Rule?

A) The study can proceed normally; the Two Consecutive Year Rule only applies to personal property
B) The depreciation method for the building is now "established" and requires filing Form 3115 (change in accounting method) to implement cost segregation results
C) Cost segregation cannot be performed after two consecutive years; the opportunity is lost
D) The study can proceed, but only 15-year land improvements can be reclassified, not 5 or 7-year property

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the Two Consecutive Year Rule, once a taxpayer uses a depreciation method on the same asset for two consecutive tax returns, that method becomes "established" and cannot be changed without IRS approval. Since the building was depreciated as 39-year property in both 2023 and 2024, implementing cost segregation results (which changes the depreciation treatment by reclassifying components) requires filing Form 3115 to request a change in accounting method. This is why many practitioners recommend performing cost segregation studies early, ideally in the first year.

## Question 7
A cost segregation practitioner is analyzing interior improvements made in 2026 to a nonresidential office building that was originally placed in service in 2020. The improvements include: new carpeting, interior partition walls, updated lighting, and HVAC ductwork modifications. Under current tax law, how should these Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) items be classified?

A) All QIP is 39-year property under MACRS GDS, not eligible for bonus depreciation
B) QIP is 15-year property under MACRS GDS, eligible for bonus depreciation at 40% for 2026
C) QIP is 7-year property and eligible for 100% bonus depreciation
D) QIP must use ADS with a 20-year recovery period and is never eligible for bonus

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Qualified Improvement Property (QIP) — interior improvements to a nonresidential building made after the building was first placed in service — is classified as 15-year property under MACRS GDS (not 7-year). QIP is eligible for bonus depreciation, though the rate has been phasing down: 20% for property placed in service in 2026. The question states 40% which was the 2025 rate, but the key concept is that QIP is 15-year property eligible for bonus. Under ADS, QIP has a 20-year recovery period.

## Question 8
A taxpayer elects to use the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS) under Section 163(j) to avoid the business interest expense limitation. How does this election affect their cost segregation study results compared to using GDS?

A) ADS has no impact on cost segregation; all recovery periods remain the same
B) ADS requires longer recovery periods and straight-line depreciation, reducing the tax benefit of cost segregation but still allowing reclassification
C) ADS eliminates the ability to perform cost segregation studies entirely
D) ADS only affects real property (27.5/39-year), not personal property identified in cost segregation

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: When a taxpayer elects ADS (often under Section 163(j) to avoid business interest expense limitations), they must use the Alternative Depreciation System which has longer recovery periods and requires straight-line depreciation. Cost segregation studies can still be performed and assets can still be reclassified from 39-year real property to shorter-lived categories, but those categories use ADS lives (which are longer than GDS) and straight-line methods. This reduces the acceleration benefit of cost segregation compared to GDS, but there is still value in reclassification.

## Question 9
A commercial building is purchased on October 5, 2026. The cost segregation study identifies: (1) $2M of building shell (39-year), (2) $300K of HVAC serving the whole building (39-year), (3) $150K of office furniture (7-year), and (4) $100K of parking lot (15-year). What depreciation convention applies to each category?

A) Half-year convention for all four categories
B) Mid-month for building shell and HVAC; half-year for office furniture and parking lot
C) Mid-month for all four categories since they're part of a building acquisition
D) Mid-quarter for all categories if the 40% test is met

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Depreciation conventions depend on the asset category. Real property (27.5 and 39-year) uses the mid-month convention, which applies to both the building shell and the building-wide HVAC system (a structural component classified as 39-year property). Personal property and land improvements use the half-year convention, which applies to the office furniture (7-year) and parking lot (15-year land improvement). The mid-quarter convention would only apply to the personal property/land improvements if more than 40% of such property was placed in service in Q4.

## Question 10
A taxpayer conducts a cost segregation study that reclassifies $500K from 39-year to 5-year property and $300K from 39-year to 15-year land improvements. The property was placed in service in 2026. Considering the phase-down of bonus depreciation, what strategic considerations should the practitioner discuss with the client?

A) Bonus depreciation is 20% in 2026 and 0% in 2027+, so immediate cost segregation captures remaining bonus on 5-year property; delaying to 2027 loses this benefit entirely
B) Since bonus is phasing out, cost segregation provides no value and should be delayed
C) The 15-year land improvements don't qualify for bonus, so only the $500K benefits from acceleration
D) Cost segregation should wait until 2027 when bonus expires to maximize straight-line deductions

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: Bonus depreciation is phasing down to 20% for property placed in service in 2026, and will be 0% starting in 2027. This creates urgency for cost segregation studies. By conducting the study in 2026, the taxpayer can claim 20% bonus depreciation on the reclassified 5-year property (and potentially the 15-year property if it qualifies as new property). If they delay until 2027 or later, they lose this bonus benefit entirely, though they still benefit from accelerated depreciation. This timing consideration is critical for maximizing tax benefits.
