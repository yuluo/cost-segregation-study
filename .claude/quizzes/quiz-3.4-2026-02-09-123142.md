## Question 1
What is the primary purpose of depreciation conventions under MACRS?

A) To determine which depreciation method to use for each asset
B) To determine how much depreciation is taken in the first and last years of an asset's life
C) To establish the recovery period for different asset classes
D) To calculate bonus depreciation eligibility

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Depreciation conventions determine how much depreciation is taken in the first and last years of an asset's life. These conventions establish the assumed date an asset was placed in service, which affects the amount of depreciation allowed in the year of acquisition and disposition. The three main conventions are the half-year convention (for most personal property), mid-quarter convention (when more than 40% of personal property is placed in service in the last quarter), and mid-month convention (for real property). The convention doesn't determine the depreciation method or recovery period—those are separate determinations under MACRS.

## Question 2
Which depreciation convention is generally used for personal property such as equipment, furniture, and fixtures?

A) Mid-month convention
B) Mid-quarter convention
C) Half-year convention
D) Full-year convention

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The half-year convention is generally used for personal property such as equipment, furniture, and fixtures. This convention assumes the asset was placed in service at the mid-point of the tax year, allowing one-half year of depreciation in the first year regardless of when the asset was actually placed in service during the year. The mid-month convention (choice A) is required for all 27.5-year and 39-year real property (residential and non-residential buildings), not personal property. The mid-quarter convention is also for personal property, but only applies in special circumstances when more than 40% of the year's personal property additions are placed in service in the last three months.

## Question 3
A taxpayer places office furniture (7-year property) in service on December 15, 2025. Under the half-year convention, how much depreciation is allowed in the first year?

A) A full year of depreciation because it was placed in service before year-end
B) One-half year of depreciation regardless of the actual date placed in service
C) Only 15 days of depreciation (December 15-31)
D) No depreciation until the following year

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Under the half-year convention, the asset is assumed to have been placed in service at the mid-point of the tax year, allowing one-half year of depreciation in the first year regardless of the actual date placed in service. This means the office furniture placed in service on December 15, 2025, receives a full six months (one-half year) of depreciation, even though it was only actually in service for about two weeks. This simplification makes depreciation calculations easier and applies uniformly to all personal property under the half-year convention, whether acquired in January or December. However, this is subject to the mid-quarter convention test—if more than 40% of the year's personal property was placed in service in the last quarter, the mid-quarter convention would apply instead.

## Question 4
When is the mid-quarter convention required instead of the half-year convention?

A) When any asset is placed in service after September 30
B) When more than 40% of the year's personal property additions are placed in service during the last three months of the tax year
C) When more than 50% of assets are placed in service in any single quarter
D) When the taxpayer elects to use it for better tax benefits

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The mid-quarter convention is required when more than 40% of the year's personal property additions (excluding real estate) are placed in service during the last three months of the tax year (October, November, December). This rule prevents taxpayers from manipulating their depreciation deductions by concentrating asset purchases late in the year to take advantage of the half-year convention, which would allow six months of depreciation even for assets purchased in December. Under the mid-quarter convention, assets are assumed to be placed in service at the mid-point of the quarter in which they were actually placed in service, resulting in depreciation amounts that vary based on the quarter of acquisition. This is sometimes called the "40% test" or "last quarter rule."

## Question 5
A company purchases $500,000 of equipment throughout 2025: $200,000 in March, $100,000 in July, and $200,000 in November. Which depreciation convention applies to all of this equipment?

A) Half-year convention, because the majority was purchased before the last quarter
B) Mid-quarter convention, because 40% ($200,000 of $500,000) was purchased in the last quarter
C) Mid-month convention, because it's equipment
D) The taxpayer can choose either half-year or mid-quarter convention

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: A ✗
**Explanation**: The half-year convention applies because exactly 40% of the equipment was purchased in the last quarter, not MORE than 40%. The mid-quarter convention is only required when MORE than 40% of the year's personal property additions are placed in service during the last three months (October, November, December). In this scenario, $200,000 out of $500,000 equals exactly 40%, which does not exceed the 40% threshold. Therefore, the half-year convention applies to all equipment purchased during 2025. This is an important distinction—the rule requires exceeding 40%, not meeting it. If the company had purchased $200,001 in November (40.0002%), then the mid-quarter convention would be required for all personal property placed in service during the year.

## Question 6
Which depreciation convention is required for a commercial building (39-year non-residential real property) placed in service on March 15, 2025?

A) Half-year convention
B) Mid-quarter convention
C) Mid-month convention
D) Full-year convention

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The mid-month convention is required for all 27.5-year and 39-year real property, which includes both residential rental property (27.5 years) and non-residential/commercial buildings (39 years). Under the mid-month convention, the property is assumed to have been placed in service at the mid-point of the month, and depreciation is based on the number of full months the property was in service during the year. For a building placed in service on March 15, 2025, depreciation would begin at mid-March, allowing 9.5 months of depreciation in 2025 (mid-March through December). The half-year and mid-quarter conventions apply only to personal property (equipment, furniture, fixtures), not real property.

## Question 7
A residential apartment building is placed in service on September 10, 2025. Under the mid-month convention, how many months of depreciation are allowed in 2025?

A) 3 months (September, October, November, December counted as 3 full months)
B) 3.5 months (mid-September through December)
C) 4 months (September through December)
D) 4.5 months (counting September as a full month plus October-December)

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the mid-month convention, the property is assumed to have been placed in service at the mid-point of the month regardless of the actual date. For a residential apartment building (27.5-year property) placed in service on September 10, 2025, the building is treated as if it were placed in service on September 15 (mid-September). This allows 3.5 months of depreciation in 2025: 0.5 months for September (from mid-month to end of month) plus 1 month each for October, November, and December. The mid-month convention simplifies calculations while providing a reasonable approximation, allowing half a month of depreciation in the month of acquisition regardless of whether the actual date was September 1, September 10, or September 30.

## Question 8
A real estate investor conducts a cost segregation study on a commercial building acquired on August 20, 2025. The study identifies $800,000 in 5-year and 7-year personal property. Assuming the half-year convention applies to the personal property and no mid-quarter issues, how do the depreciation conventions work for the building versus the segregated personal property in the first year?

A) Both the building and personal property use the mid-month convention
B) Both the building and personal property use the half-year convention
C) The building uses the mid-month convention (4.5 months in 2025) while the personal property uses the half-year convention (6 months in 2025)
D) The building uses the half-year convention while the personal property uses the mid-quarter convention

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This is a sophisticated understanding of how depreciation conventions interact with cost segregation studies. The 39-year commercial building structure itself uses the mid-month convention because it's non-residential real property. Placed in service on August 20, it's treated as placed in service mid-August, allowing 4.5 months of depreciation in 2025 (half of August plus September through December). However, the personal property components identified through the cost segregation study—the $800,000 in 5-year and 7-year property—are treated as personal property for depreciation purposes and use the half-year convention (assuming the mid-quarter test isn't triggered). This means they receive 6 months (half a year) of depreciation in 2025 regardless of the August acquisition date. This differential treatment is one reason cost segregation studies are so valuable: the segregated personal property not only has shorter recovery periods but may also receive more first-year depreciation under the half-year convention compared to the building's mid-month convention.

## Question 9
A cost segregation consultant is advising a client who will acquire multiple properties and equipment throughout 2025. The client wants to maximize depreciation but is concerned about triggering the mid-quarter convention. What strategic advice should the consultant provide regarding the timing and structuring of asset acquisitions to optimize depreciation while managing convention requirements?

A) Concentrate all equipment purchases in December to maximize the benefit of the half-year convention before year-end
B) Ensure that no more than 40% of personal property (by basis) is placed in service in Q4; consider timing major equipment purchases earlier in the year or using bonus depreciation to offset any mid-quarter impact
C) Purchase all assets in January to get a full year of depreciation under the full-year convention
D) The convention doesn't matter because bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 eliminates the first-year depreciation regardless of convention

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the sophisticated strategic advice a professional cost segregation consultant should provide. The key is to ensure that no more than 40% of the year's personal property additions (by cost basis, not by count) are placed in service in the fourth quarter (October-December). Exceeding this threshold triggers the mid-quarter convention, which can significantly reduce first-year depreciation for assets placed in service early in the year. For example, equipment purchased in January would only receive 1.5 months of depreciation under mid-quarter (mid-Q1) versus 6 months under half-year. Strategic timing of major equipment purchases earlier in the year helps avoid this trap. Additionally, the consultant should note that with permanent 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 for qualifying property placed in service after January 19, 2025, the convention becomes less critical for bonus-eligible assets (which receive immediate full expensing anyway), but it still matters for property that doesn't qualify for bonus depreciation or if the taxpayer elects out of bonus. Choice A is terrible advice—it would trigger mid-quarter and reduce overall depreciation deductions.

---

## Question 10
Consider the interaction between depreciation conventions and the permanent 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025. A taxpayer argues that because bonus depreciation provides 100% first-year expensing for qualifying property, depreciation conventions are now completely irrelevant and don't need to be considered in tax planning. Evaluate this argument from a comprehensive tax compliance and planning perspective.

A) The argument is correct—conventions no longer matter when 100% bonus depreciation is available
B) The argument is incorrect—conventions remain critical because: (1) not all property qualifies for bonus (e.g., real property, used property in certain cases); (2) taxpayers may elect out of bonus for various reasons; (3) conventions affect year of disposition; (4) proper convention determination is required for IRS compliance even if it doesn't affect current-year tax
C) The argument is partially correct—conventions only matter for the building structure, not for any personal property
D) Conventions have been eliminated by OBBBA 2025 and no longer exist in the tax code

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the comprehensive and professionally sound analysis. While OBBBA 2025's permanent 100% bonus depreciation dramatically changes the landscape for qualifying property, depreciation conventions remain essential for multiple reasons: (1) **Not all property qualifies for bonus**—most notably, the 39-year building structure itself doesn't qualify, and certain used property may not qualify depending on the acquisition circumstances; (2) **Elective nature**—taxpayers can elect out of bonus depreciation for various strategic reasons (managing alternative minimum tax, preserving higher basis for future appreciation, coordinating with passive activity losses, or working with partnership allocations); (3) **Disposition year impact**—conventions determine depreciation in the year property is disposed of, affecting gain/loss calculations; (4) **Compliance requirements**—the IRS still requires proper convention determination and reporting on Form 4562 even when bonus depreciation makes the convention's first-year impact moot. A sophisticated tax advisor understands that bonus depreciation doesn't eliminate conventions; it simply makes them less consequential for qualifying property while preserving their critical importance for everything else.
