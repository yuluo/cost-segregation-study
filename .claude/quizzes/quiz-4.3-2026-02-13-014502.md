## Question 1
List the FIRST THREE of the nine enumerated building systems in order:

A) HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical
B) Structural, Foundation, Roofing
C) Elevators, Escalators, HVAC
D) Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: The first three of the nine specifically enumerated building systems are: (1) HVAC system, (2) Plumbing system, and (3) Electrical system. These are always listed in this order and are among the most commonly encountered building systems in cost segregation work. Note that Answer B (Structural, Foundation, Roofing) is incorrect because those are NOT enumerated systems - they are components of the building structure UOP itself. Memorizing the order of all nine systems is critical for the ASCSP exam and professional practice.

## Question 2
Which of the following are part of the building structure UOP and NOT separate enumerated building systems?

A) HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical
B) Foundation, Walls, Roof, Floors
C) Escalators, Elevators, Fire protection
D) Security systems, Gas distribution

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Foundation, Walls, Roof, and Floors are all components of the building structure UOP (the building envelope and frame). They are NOT separate enumerated building systems. This is a critical distinction: the building structure is ONE Unit of Property that includes all structural components (foundation, walls, roof, floors, windows, doors, structural frame), while each of the nine enumerated building systems (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Escalators, Elevators, Fire protection and alarm, Security, Gas distribution, Other identified systems) is a SEPARATE UOP. Understanding this distinction prevents the common mistake of thinking roofing, foundation, or structural components are separate building systems.

## Question 3
Complete the list: The nine enumerated building systems are: HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, _______, _______, Fire protection and alarm, Security, Gas distribution, and Other identified systems.

A) Roofing, Windows
B) Foundation, Structural
C) Escalators, Elevators
D) Doors, Flooring

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The nine enumerated building systems are: (1) HVAC, (2) Plumbing, (3) Electrical, (4) Escalators, (5) Elevators, (6) Fire protection and alarm systems, (7) Security systems, (8) Gas distribution system, and (9) Other systems identified in regulations. Escalators and Elevators are positions 4 and 5 in the enumeration. All other answer choices (Roofing, Windows, Foundation, Structural, Doors, Flooring) are components of the building structure, NOT separate building systems. This is a key memorization point - only these nine specific categories are enumerated systems that get analyzed separately from the building structure.

## Question 4
A commercial building has the following components: exterior brick walls, asphalt shingle roof, concrete foundation, HVAC rooftop units, interior plumbing, and an elevator. How many separate Units of Property exist for these components?

A) Six separate UOPs (one for each component)
B) One UOP (the entire building)
C) Four UOPs: building structure, HVAC, plumbing, elevator
D) Two UOPs: the building and its mechanical systems

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: There are four separate Units of Property: (1) The building structure UOP includes the exterior brick walls, asphalt shingle roof, and concrete foundation - these are all part of the building envelope/frame; (2) The HVAC system UOP includes the rooftop units; (3) The plumbing system UOP includes the interior plumbing; (4) The elevator system UOP. This demonstrates the two-level capitalization framework: one UOP for the building structure, and separate UOPs for each of the nine enumerated building systems present in the building. The building structure components (walls, roof, foundation) are grouped together as one UOP, while each enumerated system is its own separate UOP.

## Question 5
Which statement correctly describes the relationship between the building structure and the nine enumerated building systems?

A) The nine systems are subsystems within the building structure UOP
B) The building structure and each of the nine systems are analyzed as separate, independent UOPs
C) Only work on the nine systems requires BAR test analysis; building structure work is automatically capitalized
D) The nine systems must be combined with the building structure for repair analysis

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The building structure and each of the nine enumerated building systems are analyzed as separate, independent Units of Property. This is the fundamental two-level capitalization framework: (1) the building structure (envelope and frame) is one UOP, and (2) each of the nine enumerated building systems is a separate UOP. Work on the building structure is analyzed independently from work on any of the nine systems. For example, replacing exterior walls (building structure UOP) is analyzed separately from replacing an HVAC compressor (HVAC system UOP). Each UOP has its own BAR test analysis to determine if work constitutes a repair or improvement. They are not subsystems, not combined, and both require independent BAR test analysis.

## Question 6
A hotel replaces the carpeting in all guest rooms and hallways. The carpet is glued to the concrete subfloor. Under the UOP framework, how is this expenditure analyzed?

A) The carpet is part of the HVAC system since it affects air quality
B) The carpet is part of the building structure UOP (flooring component), so this is analyzed as potential work on the building structure
C) Each room's carpet is a separate UOP
D) The carpet is personal property outside the UOP framework

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Carpet/flooring is a component of the building structure UOP, not one of the nine enumerated building systems. The building structure includes the envelope and frame, which encompasses floors, walls, roof, foundation, windows, doors, and finishes like flooring. Therefore, replacing the carpeting is analyzed as work on the building structure UOP and must be evaluated under the BAR tests (Betterment, Adaptation, Restoration) to determine if it improves the building structure (requiring capitalization) or merely repairs it (deductible). This is a common area of confusion - many think flooring might be a separate system or personal property, but installed flooring is part of the building structure. Only the nine specifically enumerated systems (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Escalators, Elevators, Fire protection, Security, Gas distribution, Other identified) are separate from the building structure.

## Question 7
A shopping mall has separate HVAC systems for: (1) the common area, (2) each individual retail tenant space, and (3) the food court. A contractor performs work on the food court HVAC system. How is the Unit of Property defined for this work?

A) All three HVAC systems combined, since they're in the same building
B) Only the food court HVAC system is the UOP for this work
C) The entire building structure plus all HVAC systems is the UOP
D) The common area and food court systems combined, excluding tenant spaces

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: When a building has multiple systems of the same type serving different functional areas, each system is treated as a separate Unit of Property. The food court HVAC system is a separate UOP from the common area HVAC system and from each tenant space HVAC system. Work performed on the food court HVAC system is analyzed only against that specific system's UOP - not combined with the other HVAC systems. This follows the established principle that each of the nine enumerated building systems serving distinct functional areas constitutes a separate UOP. The contractor's work would be evaluated under the BAR tests to determine if it betters, adapts, or restores the food court HVAC system UOP specifically.

## Question 8
A data center replaces its specialized cooling system that serves only the server room equipment, while the building's general HVAC system (serving offices and common areas) remains unchanged. How should the cooling system replacement be analyzed under the UOP framework?

A) Both cooling systems must be analyzed together as one HVAC UOP
B) The specialized cooling system is its own separate UOP, and only that system is analyzed for this expenditure
C) The specialized cooling is personal property, not subject to UOP analysis
D) The entire building structure is the UOP since both systems are permanently installed

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The specialized cooling system serving the server room equipment is a separate HVAC system UOP, distinct from the building's general HVAC system serving offices and common areas. When there are multiple HVAC systems (or any of the nine enumerated building systems) serving different functional areas or purposes, each is treated as a separate Unit of Property. The replacement of the specialized cooling system would be analyzed only against that specific system's UOP to determine if it's a full replacement of the UOP (requiring capitalization) or a partial replacement requiring BAR test analysis. The general building HVAC system is irrelevant to this analysis. This demonstrates how the UOP framework creates clear boundaries for independent analysis based on functional interdependence and functional area served.

## Question 9
A cost segregation study identifies that a building has work performed on its foundation, roof, fire sprinkler system, and backup generator electrical system. The professional needs to determine how many separate BAR test analyses are required. How many independent BAR test analyses should be performed?

A) One analysis for the entire building
B) Two analyses: one for structural items (foundation/roof) and one for systems (sprinkler/electrical)
C) Three analyses: building structure (foundation/roof), fire protection system, electrical system
D) Four analyses: one for each component

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Three separate BAR test analyses are required: (1) Building structure UOP analysis for the foundation and roof work (these are both components of the building structure, so they're analyzed together as work on one UOP); (2) Fire protection and alarm system UOP analysis for the fire sprinkler system; (3) Electrical system UOP analysis for the backup generator electrical system. This demonstrates the two-level capitalization framework in practice: the building structure is one UOP (combining foundation and roof work), while each of the nine enumerated building systems (fire protection, electrical) is analyzed as a separate UOP. Each independent UOP requires its own BAR test analysis to determine if the work betters, adapts, or restores that specific UOP. You cannot combine analyses across different UOPs.

## Question 10
A building owner wants to maximize current-year deductions. They have upcoming work on windows (replacing old single-pane with energy-efficient double-pane), plumbing (replacing corroded pipes in restrooms), and security cameras (upgrading to digital system). An advisor suggests analyzing each as a separate UOP. Is this correct, and why?

A) Correct - windows, plumbing, and security are each separate enumerated building systems
B) Incorrect - all three should be combined as one building UOP
C) Partially correct - plumbing and security are separate UOPs, but windows are part of the building structure UOP
D) Incorrect - only security cameras are a separate UOP; windows and plumbing are both part of building structure

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The advisor is partially correct. Plumbing and Security are both among the nine enumerated building systems, so each constitutes a separate UOP requiring independent BAR test analysis. However, windows are NOT one of the nine enumerated systems - windows are components of the building structure (part of the building envelope), so they should be analyzed as part of the building structure UOP, not as a separate system. This is a critical distinction that professionals must understand: only the nine specifically enumerated systems (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Escalators, Elevators, Fire protection and alarm, Security, Gas distribution, Other identified systems) are separate UOPs. Everything else that's part of the building envelope/frame (windows, doors, walls, roof, floors, foundation) is analyzed as part of the building structure UOP.
