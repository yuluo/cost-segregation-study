A) The final document delivered to the client with depreciation schedules
B) The technical process of conducting the analysis
C) The IRS audit review of a taxpayer's depreciation claims
D) The professional certification attached to a report

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: The ASCSP defines the Cost Segregation Study (CSS) as the technical process of conducting the analysis. This includes site observations and inspections, document reviews, engineering-based procedures, cost estimation and allocation, and asset classification analysis.

## Question 2
Which of the following is a component of the **CSR** (Cost Segregation Report)?

A) Site observations and inspections
B) Engineering-based procedures
C) Cost estimation and allocation
D) Supporting schedules and documentation

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: D ✗
**Explanation**: The CSR (Cost Segregation Report) is the deliverable document. Its components include: study methodology explanation, legal rationale and tax law application, final cost conclusions and classifications, supporting schedules and documentation, and professional certification. Options A, B, and C are components of the CSS (the study process).

## Question 3
The IRS Audit Techniques Guide identifies how many "principal elements" of a quality cost segregation study and report?

A) 7
B) 10
C) 13
D) 15

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: C ✗

## Question 4
A property owner tells their CPA: "I have the cost segregation study but I haven't seen the report yet." Based on the ASCSP distinction, what is the most likely misunderstanding?

A) The owner is confusing the study with the engagement letter
B) The owner likely has the report (CSR) and is using "study" loosely, since clients don't typically observe the analytical process
C) The owner is referring to two separate documents that are always delivered independently
D) The owner correctly distinguishes between the process and the deliverable

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Clients often use "study" and "report" interchangeably. What clients receive is the CSR — the deliverable document. They don't directly observe the CSS (the analytical process). When the owner says "I have the study," they most likely have the report.

## Question 5
A cost segregation firm has completed site inspections, reviewed all blueprints, and finished engineering analysis. They have NOT yet written anything up. Which statement is accurate?

A) The CSS is complete; the CSR has not yet been produced
B) The CSR is complete; the CSS has not yet begun
C) Both the CSS and CSR are complete
D) Neither the CSS nor CSR is complete because nothing has been documented

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: A ✓
**Explanation**: The CSS encompasses the technical process — site inspections, document reviews, engineering analysis. Once that work is done, the CSS is complete. The CSR (the written deliverable) has not yet been produced since nothing has been written up.

## Question 6
According to the IRS, a "quality" cost segregation study and report should always do three things. Which of the following is NOT one of them?

A) Classify assets into property classes
B) Explain the legal rationale for classifying assets as §1245 or §1250 property
C) Guarantee the taxpayer will not be audited
D) Substantiate the cost basis of each asset and reconcile total allocated costs to total actual costs

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: No study can guarantee freedom from audit. The IRS states a quality study should: classify assets, explain legal rationale for §1245/§1250 classification, and substantiate cost basis with reconciliation.

## Question 7
Only holders of which ASCSP designation can stamp a cost segregation report with the ASCSP seal?

A) CPA (Certified Public Accountant)
B) PE (Professional Engineer)
C) CCSP (Certified Cost Segregation Professional)
D) ASCSP Associate Member

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Only Certified Members with the CCSP designation can stamp a cost segregation report with the ASCSP seal and use the ASCSP designation in correspondence and credentials.

---

## Question 8
A provider delivers a cost segregation report that uses a "rule of thumb" method — applying fixed percentages without documentation or site visits. According to the IRS Audit Techniques Guide, how is this approach viewed?

A) It is the IRS-preferred methodology for smaller properties
B) It is acceptable as long as the percentages are industry-standard
C) The IRS explicitly warns against this method due to lack of documentation
D) It is only acceptable if certified by a CCSP

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The IRS ATG explicitly warns against "rule of thumb" methods that apply fixed percentages without documentation. The IRS strongly prefers a detailed engineering approach described as "the most methodical and accurate approach."

## Question 9
A taxpayer is selecting a cost segregation provider. Provider X offers a low-cost report with impressive savings projections but no audit support. Provider Y charges more but includes thorough engineering analysis and audit support hours. What does ASCSP guidance suggest?

A) Always choose the lowest-cost provider to maximize ROI
B) The size of projected tax savings is the most important factor
C) The true value of the fee is how well the work stands up to IRS scrutiny, not just the projected savings
D) Audit support is unnecessary if the report includes a professional certification

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The ASCSP emphasizes that "any company can give you a report with results that save you a lot of money; the real question is whether it will stand up to IRS scrutiny. The true value of the fee you pay is how easy (or painful) the audit process goes."

## Question 10
A cost segregation engagement produces a report containing all 13 IRS principal elements, is based on a thorough study with site visits and engineering analysis, and is prepared by a CCSP. During an IRS audit, what is the most likely outcome?

A) The IRS will automatically reject the study
B) The examination will typically result in no adjustments, as the study meets quality standards
C) The IRS will require the study to be redone by their own engineers
D) The taxpayer will need to hire a separate legal team to defend the classifications

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: When a study includes all 13 principal elements, IRS examination typically results in no adjustments. A quality study greatly expedites the Service's review, minimizing audit burden on all parties.
