## Question 1
What is Treasury Decision 9636?

A) A 2020 executive order that eliminated depreciation schedules for commercial property
B) The 2013 final regulations that provide rules for applying IRC sections 162(a) and 263(a) to tangible property
C) A temporary regulation that expired in 2018 for repair expense deductions
D) An IRS audit guideline for cost segregation study methodology

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Treasury Decision 9636 (TD 9636) is the final Tangible Property Regulations issued by the IRS on September 17, 2013. These regulations provide comprehensive rules for applying IRC sections 162(a) and 263(a) to costs paid to acquire, produce, or improve tangible property. Section 162(a) allows deductions for ordinary and necessary business expenses (including repairs and maintenance), while section 263(a) requires capitalization of costs to acquire, produce, or improve tangible property. TD 9636 was designed to clarify and expand the standards for whether an expenditure is a deductible repair or a capital improvement, providing more certainty for taxpayers. The final regulations became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and remain the current governing framework as of 2025-2026.

## Question 2
What was the primary purpose of the Tangible Property Regulations (TD 9636)?

A) To eliminate all depreciation deductions for tangible property
B) To clarify and expand the standards for whether an expenditure is a deductible repair or a capital improvement
C) To require all property costs to be capitalized regardless of nature
D) To simplify tax reporting by treating all maintenance as capital improvements

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The primary purpose of the Tangible Property Regulations (TD 9636) was to clarify and expand the standards for whether an expenditure is a deductible repair expense under IRC §162(a) or a capital improvement that must be capitalized under IRC §263(a). Prior to these regulations, there was significant uncertainty and inconsistency in how taxpayers and the IRS applied the repair vs. capitalization rules. The regulations were designed to provide more certainty for taxpayers by establishing clear tests and frameworks (such as the BAR tests—betterments, adaptations, and restorations) to determine proper treatment. This clarity is particularly important for cost segregation studies, as proper classification of costs affects depreciation schedules and tax planning strategies. The regulations do not eliminate depreciation or require all costs to be capitalized; rather, they provide a structured approach to making these determinations.

## Question 3
When did the final Tangible Property Regulations (TD 9636) become effective?

A) Tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2010
B) Tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2014
C) Tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018
D) Tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The final Tangible Property Regulations (Treasury Decision 9636) became effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2014. While proposed versions of these regulations existed earlier, the final regulations were issued on September 17, 2013, and taxpayers were required to apply them starting with tax years beginning in 2014. This effective date is important for cost segregation professionals because it establishes when the current framework for distinguishing repairs from capital improvements became mandatory. Properties acquired or improved before this date may have been treated under the old, less structured rules, while properties after this date must follow the comprehensive TD 9636 framework. The regulations continue to govern these determinations in 2025-2026, providing the stable regulatory environment that taxpayers and advisors rely upon for tax planning and compliance.

## Question 4
A business spends $15,000 replacing worn-out shingles on a portion of their warehouse roof. The replacement maintains the roof in ordinary operating condition but does not materially add to its value, substantially prolong its useful life, or adapt it to a new use. Under IRC §162(a) and §263(a), how should this expenditure most likely be treated?

A) Capitalize the entire $15,000 as an improvement under §263(a) because it involves the building structure
B) Deduct the $15,000 as a repair expense under §162(a) because it maintains the property in ordinary operating condition
C) Capitalize 50% and expense 50% to split the difference
D) Always capitalize roof work regardless of scope or purpose

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the Tangible Property Regulations (TD 9636), this expenditure should be deducted as a repair expense under IRC §162(a). The key factors are that the work: (1) maintains the property in ordinary operating condition, (2) does not materially add to its value, (3) does not substantially prolong its useful life, and (4) does not adapt it to a new use. These characteristics indicate routine repair and maintenance, not a capital improvement requiring capitalization under §263(a). The regulations provide that repairs are generally deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses. In contrast, if the roof replacement were a betterment (materially increasing value or capacity), a restoration (replacing a major component or structural part), or an adaptation to a new use, it would need to be capitalized. The amount ($15,000) and the fact that it involves a building component don't automatically require capitalization—the critical test is the nature and effect of the expenditure. This distinction is fundamental to cost segregation analysis and proper tax treatment of property costs.

## Question 5
A taxpayer owns a commercial office building and spends $80,000 to replace the entire HVAC system because the old system was no longer functional. The new system has similar capacity and does not adapt the building to a new use. Under the TD 9636 framework, how should this expenditure most likely be classified?

A) Deduct as a repair under §162(a) because HVAC systems always qualify as routine maintenance
B) Capitalize under §263(a) as a restoration because it replaces a major component or substantial structural part
C) Deduct 80% and capitalize 20% based on the de minimis safe harbor
D) Treat as Section 179 property regardless of the §263(a) determination

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the Tangible Property Regulations (TD 9636), this expenditure must be capitalized under IRC §263(a) as a restoration. The regulations establish the "BAR tests" (Betterments, Adaptations, and Restorations) to determine whether costs must be capitalized. A restoration includes costs to replace a major component or substantial structural part of a unit of property. An HVAC system is considered a major building system and a substantial structural part of the building. Even though the new system has similar capacity and doesn't adapt the building to a new use, the complete replacement of a major system that was no longer functional constitutes a restoration requiring capitalization. This is different from routine HVAC maintenance (like filter changes or minor repairs), which would be deductible under §162(a). Once capitalized, the $80,000 would be depreciated over the appropriate recovery period—potentially 39 years as part of the building, or if properly segregated, it might qualify as 15-year QIP (qualified improvement property) if the building was already in service. This classification directly impacts cost segregation analysis and tax planning strategies.

## Question 6
A taxpayer with $8 million in average annual gross receipts spends $4,500 on various minor repairs and maintenance for an office building during 2025. Under the TD 9636 safe harbor provisions, can the taxpayer potentially elect to deduct these costs without detailed capitalization analysis?

A) No, all building costs must be analyzed individually under the BAR tests regardless of amount
B) Yes, if the taxpayer makes the proper election, amounts under certain thresholds for eligible building property may be deducted
C) No, safe harbors only apply to taxpayers with gross receipts under $1 million
D) Yes, but only if the work is performed by licensed contractors

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Yes, under the TD 9636 safe harbor provisions, this taxpayer may elect to deduct these costs without detailed capitalization analysis. The regulations provide a safe harbor election for taxpayers whose average annual gross receipts are $10 million or less. Since this taxpayer has $8 million in average annual gross receipts, they qualify. Under this safe harbor, if the taxpayer makes the proper election, they may deduct amounts paid for repairs, maintenance, or improvements of certain eligible building property if the total amounts paid during the taxable year don't exceed specific dollar limitations. The $4,500 spent on minor repairs and maintenance would likely fall well within these thresholds. This safe harbor significantly simplifies compliance for small and medium-sized businesses by eliminating the need to perform detailed BAR test analysis on relatively minor expenditures. However, the taxpayer must make an affirmative election to use this safe harbor, and it only applies to eligible building property. This provision recognizes the administrative burden of analyzing every minor building expense and provides practical relief for qualifying taxpayers.

## Question 7
A commercial property owner incurs the following costs in 2025: (1) $3,000 to repaint the exterior for routine maintenance; (2) $50,000 to replace the entire roof because it was damaged and leaking; (3) $2,000 for annual HVAC servicing; (4) $75,000 to add a new wing to the building. Under TD 9636, which costs should be capitalized?

A) Only the $75,000 new wing addition
B) The $50,000 roof replacement and $75,000 wing addition
C) All costs must be capitalized because they exceed $10,000 total
D) Only the HVAC servicing should be capitalized

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Under TD 9636 and the BAR tests (Betterments, Adaptations, Restorations), the $50,000 roof replacement and the $75,000 wing addition should be capitalized under IRC §263(a). Here's the analysis:

1. **$3,000 repainting** - This is routine maintenance that keeps the property in ordinary operating condition without materially adding to its value or prolonging useful life. **Deductible under §162(a)**.

2. **$50,000 roof replacement** - Replacing the entire roof because it was damaged and leaking constitutes a restoration (replacing a major component or structural part that was no longer functional). **Must be capitalized under §263(a)**.

3. **$2,000 HVAC servicing** - Annual servicing and maintenance of the HVAC system is routine upkeep, not a restoration or betterment. **Deductible under §162(a)**.

4. **$75,000 wing addition** - Adding a new wing to the building is an enlargement that materially adds to the property's value and represents a betterment. **Must be capitalized under §263(a)**.

The annual HVAC servicing should definitely be deducted, not capitalized—it's exactly the type of routine maintenance expense that §162(a) permits as a current deduction. The capitalization requirement applies to the roof replacement (restoration) and wing addition (betterment/enlargement).

## Question 8
A cost segregation professional is advising a client who acquired a 10-year-old manufacturing facility in 2025. The client is planning $500,000 in improvements including: structural repairs to the foundation ($100,000), replacement of obsolete production equipment mounts ($150,000), repainting the interior ($50,000), and upgrading the electrical system to accommodate new machinery ($200,000). How should the professional analyze these costs under TD 9636 to maximize tax benefits while maintaining compliance?

A) Capitalize all costs as building improvements since they total over $250,000
B) Apply the BAR tests individually to each cost: foundation repairs likely capitalize as restoration, equipment mounts may be deductible if removable personal property under cost segregation, repainting likely deductible as routine maintenance, electrical upgrade likely capitalizes as betterment/adaptation; then consider if any capitalized items qualify as QIP or shorter-life property
C) Deduct everything under the safe harbor since the building is over 3 years old
D) Capitalize everything to maximize depreciation deductions over 39 years

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the sophisticated, professional approach that a cost segregation expert should employ. The analysis requires applying the BAR tests (Betterments, Adaptations, Restorations) individually to each expenditure rather than treating them as a lump sum:

1. **Foundation repairs ($100K)** - Structural repairs to the foundation likely constitute a restoration under TD 9636 (fixing a major structural component). **Must be capitalized**.

2. **Equipment mounts ($150K)** - This requires careful analysis. If these are removable personal property (not permanently affixed to the building structure), they may be identified through cost segregation as 5-year or 7-year property rather than building improvements. If they're structural, they'd be capitalized. **Cost segregation analysis is key**.

3. **Repainting ($50K)** - Interior repainting is typically routine maintenance that maintains the property in ordinary operating condition. **Likely deductible under §162(a)**.

4. **Electrical upgrade ($200K)** - Upgrading the electrical system to accommodate new machinery represents either a betterment (materially increasing capacity) or an adaptation (enabling a new or different use). **Must be capitalized**.

After determining which costs must be capitalized, the professional should then analyze whether those capitalized items qualify as QIP (qualified improvement property with 15-year recovery) or other shorter-life property through cost segregation, rather than treating everything as 39-year building property. This maximizes tax benefits by accelerating depreciation while maintaining full compliance with TD 9636. This integrated approach demonstrates how the tangible property regulations and cost segregation work together in sophisticated tax planning.

## Question 9
A taxpayer acquired a building in 2018 and treated all costs as 39-year property. In 2025, they conduct a cost segregation study identifying $2 million in personal property (5-year, 7-year, 15-year) that should have been classified differently from the start. To correct the depreciation method, they must file Form 3115. How do the TD 9636 tangible property regulations interact with this accounting method change, and what considerations should the taxpayer address?

A) TD 9636 prevents any retroactive reclassification; the taxpayer must continue using 39-year depreciation
B) The taxpayer must first apply TD 9636's BAR tests to confirm the $2M qualifies as personal property (not building improvements requiring capitalization), then file Form 3115 to change from 39-year to appropriate shorter recovery periods, capturing catch-up depreciation via Section 481(a) adjustment; must ensure identified property doesn't include items that would be capitalized as betterments/restorations under TD 9636
C) TD 9636 only applies to new acquisitions after 2014, so it doesn't affect this 2018 property
D) The accounting method change automatically overrides TD 9636 requirements

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This demonstrates the sophisticated interaction between TD 9636's tangible property regulations and accounting method changes via Form 3115 in cost segregation. The process requires:

1. **Apply TD 9636 framework first**: Before reclassifying any property from 39-year building to shorter-life personal property, the taxpayer must confirm that the identified assets properly qualify as personal property under TD 9636. The BAR tests (Betterments, Adaptations, Restorations) are critical here—items that are betterments to the building structure, restorations of major building components, or adaptations may need to remain capitalized as building improvements rather than being reclassified as removable personal property.

2. **File Form 3115 for accounting method change**: Once proper classification is confirmed under TD 9636, Form 3115 (Application for Change in Accounting Method) is filed to change from the incorrect 39-year straight-line method to the appropriate shorter recovery periods (5-year, 7-year, 15-year MACRS) for the identified personal property.

3. **Section 481(a) adjustment**: The catch-up depreciation from 2018-2024 is captured through the Section 481(a) adjustment, providing immediate tax benefit in 2025.

4. **Compliance requirement**: The cost segregation study must ensure that identified personal property components don't include items that TD 9636 would classify as structural improvements requiring continued capitalization as building property. For example, structural electrical systems, plumbing permanently integrated into the building structure, or foundation elements would fail the personal property test under TD 9636.

This integrated analysis ensures both compliance with tangible property regulations and maximization of tax benefits through proper cost segregation and accounting method correction.

## Question 10
Congress is considering potential modifications to the tangible property regulations. A CFO asks their tax advisor how changes to TD 9636's repair vs. capitalization rules might affect the company's multi-year capital planning, existing cost segregation studies, and accumulated depreciation on properties acquired from 2018-2025. What is the most sophisticated and professionally sound analysis?

A) TD 9636 is final and permanent; Congress cannot modify these regulations, so no planning adjustments are needed
B) While TD 9636 remains current law, Congress or Treasury could modify these regulations through future legislation or regulatory updates; prudent planning should optimize under current rules while maintaining flexibility, documenting the basis for repair vs. capitalization decisions thoroughly for audit defense, and recognizing that changes to these rules could affect future treatment but generally wouldn't require retroactive adjustments to closed years; consider how potential tightening or loosening of capitalization rules might impact timing of planned improvements
C) Assume TD 9636 will be eliminated by 2027 and capitalize all costs conservatively
D) Changes to repair regulations never affect existing cost segregation studies, only new properties

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is the most sophisticated and professionally sound analysis that recognizes both the stability and potential evolution of tax regulations. Here's the comprehensive framework:

**Current Law Status**: TD 9636 remains the governing framework for tangible property determinations as of 2025-2026, having been in effect since 2014. However, Congress retains legislative authority to modify IRC §162(a) and §263(a), and Treasury can issue new or amended regulations affecting these provisions.

**Prudent Planning Principles**:

1. **Optimize under current law** - Take full advantage of current repair vs. capitalization rules and cost segregation opportunities. Don't forego legitimate tax benefits due to speculation about future changes.

2. **Maintain flexibility** - Structure transactions and documentation to preserve options if rules change. Don't lock into irreversible positions based solely on current rules.

3. **Document thoroughly** - Maintain comprehensive documentation of the factual basis and analysis supporting repair vs. capitalization decisions. This provides audit defense under current rules and creates a defensible record if rules change.

4. **Understand retroactivity limitations** - Generally, regulatory changes apply prospectively to transactions after the effective date. Closed tax years (beyond statute of limitations) are typically protected. However, open years could be affected by certain types of changes.

5. **Strategic timing considerations** - If regulations might tighten (require more capitalization), consider accelerating improvements to benefit from current more favorable treatment. If regulations might loosen (allow more expensing), consider whether to delay certain improvements.

**Impact on Existing Cost Segregation Studies**: Changes to TD 9636 would primarily affect how future costs are classified rather than requiring adjustments to properly documented positions taken in closed years. However, ongoing depreciation on open-year properties could be affected by certain types of regulatory changes.

This balanced approach maximizes current tax benefits while acknowledging regulatory and legislative dynamics, serving clients' long-term interests without either naive assumptions of permanence or excessive conservatism that foregoes legitimate current benefits.
