## Question 1
The ASCSP distinguishes between the CSS and CSR. The **CSS** is best described as:

A) The documented results provided to the client
B) The professional certification stamped on the deliverable
C) The technical process of conducting the analysis
D) The legal rationale supporting asset classifications

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The CSS (Cost Segregation Study) is the technical process that includes site observations, document reviews, engineering-based procedures, cost estimation, and asset classification analysis.

---

## Question 2
Which of the following is a component of the **CSR** (Cost Segregation Report), NOT the CSS?

A) Site observations and inspections
B) Document reviews of construction records and blueprints
C) Professional certification
D) Cost estimation and allocation

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The CSR components are: study methodology explanation, legal rationale, final cost conclusions, supporting schedules, and professional certification. Site observations (A), document reviews (B), and cost estimation (D) are CSS components.

## Question 3
The IRS Audit Techniques Guide identifies a specific number of "principal elements" that define a quality cost segregation study and report. How many elements are there?

A) 9
B) 11
C) 13
D) 17

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The IRS ATG Chapter 4 identifies 13 principal elements of a quality cost segregation study and report.

## Question 4
A client emails their CPA saying: "Can you send me the cost segregation study?" Based on the ASCSP distinction, what are they most likely asking for?

A) Permission to observe the engineering team during the site inspection
B) The Cost Segregation Report — the deliverable document
C) A copy of the raw engineering take-off worksheets
D) The engagement letter that initiated the project

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Clients commonly use "study" and "report" interchangeably. When asking to be "sent" the study, they mean the deliverable document (CSR).

---

## Question 5
An engineering firm has completed all site inspections, reviewed blueprints and invoices, performed cost allocation, and classified all assets. However, they have not yet compiled the written deliverable. What is the status of the engagement?

A) Both the CSS and CSR are complete
B) Neither is complete — documentation is required for both
C) The CSS is complete; the CSR has not yet been produced
D) The CSR is complete; the CSS still needs finalization

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The CSS encompasses the technical work. Once that analytical work is done, the CSS is complete. The CSR (written deliverable) has not yet been produced.

---

## Question 6
A provider delivers a polished cost segregation report with impressive depreciation schedules, but they never conducted a site visit, never reviewed construction documents, and used a "rule of thumb" percentage method. Which statement best describes this situation?

A) Both the CSS and CSR were completed properly
B) The CSR was delivered but a proper CSS was never performed
C) This is acceptable for properties under $1 million
D) The CSS was completed using an alternative IRS-approved methodology

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Without site visits, document review, or proper engineering procedures, the provider skipped the study process. They produced a report without the underlying analytical work. The IRS explicitly warns against rule of thumb methods.

---

## Question 7
Which of the following is one of the three things the IRS says a quality cost segregation study and report should **always** do?

A) Include photographic documentation of every building component
B) Be prepared by a CCSP-certified professional
C) Explain the rationale, including legal citations, for classifying assets as §1245 or §1250 property
D) Provide a guarantee of audit protection for the taxpayer

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The IRS states a quality study/report should always: (1) classify assets into property classes, (2) explain the rationale including legal citations for §1245/§1250 classification, and (3) substantiate cost basis and reconcile allocated costs to actual costs.

---

## Question 8
The IRS describes which methodology as "the most methodical and accurate approach" for conducting a cost segregation study?

A) Rule of thumb percentage method
B) Residual estimation technique
C) Detailed engineering from actual records
D) Sampling and statistical modeling

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The IRS describes "detailed engineering from actual records" as "the most methodical and accurate approach," using cost information from contemporaneous construction and accounting records.

---

## Question 9
A CPA is comparing two cost segregation providers. Provider A projects $500K in tax savings at a low fee but offers no audit support. Provider B projects $400K in savings at a higher fee but includes thorough engineering analysis and audit support hours. According to ASCSP guidance, what is the most important consideration?

A) Choose Provider A because maximizing projected savings is the primary goal
B) Choose the provider with the lowest fee to maximize net benefit
C) The true value is whether the work will withstand IRS scrutiny — not the size of projected savings
D) Both providers are equivalent since they both produce a report

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The ASCSP emphasizes that "the real question is whether it will stand up to IRS scrutiny. The true value of the fee you pay is how easy (or painful) the audit process goes."

---

## Question 10
A cost segregation engagement includes all 13 IRS principal elements, was performed by a CCSP with thorough site visits and engineering analysis, and is documented in a comprehensive report. If the IRS examines this taxpayer's depreciation deductions, what is the most likely outcome?

A) The IRS will require the entire study to be redone by government engineers
B) The examination will typically result in no adjustments
C) The taxpayer will still face significant penalties regardless of study quality
D) The IRS will only accept the study if it was prepared using the residual estimation method

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: When a study includes all 13 principal elements, IRS examination typically results in no adjustments. Quality studies greatly expedite the Service's review and minimize audit burden.
