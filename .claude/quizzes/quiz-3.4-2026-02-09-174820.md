## Question 1
Under the half-year convention, when is an asset assumed to be placed in service?

A) On the first day of the tax year (January 1)
B) On the last day of the tax year (December 31)
C) At the mid-point of the tax year (June 30 or July 1)
D) On the actual date it was placed in service

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Under the half-year convention, assets are assumed to be placed in service at the mid-point of the tax year, regardless of the actual date placed in service. This means that whether you purchase equipment on January 5 or December 28, it's treated as if it was placed in service on June 30 or July 1 (the midpoint of the year). This simplification allows for one-half year (6 months) of depreciation in the first year and one-half year in the final year of the asset's recovery period. This convention applies to personal property such as equipment, furniture, and fixtures, making depreciation calculations uniform and straightforward.

## Question 2
Which of the following asset types would typically use the half-year convention for depreciation?

A) A residential apartment building
B) Office computers and desks
C) A commercial warehouse building
D) Land improvements such as parking lots

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Office computers and desks are classified as personal property (5-year property for computers, 7-year property for office furniture) and use the half-year convention. Residential apartment buildings (27.5-year property) and commercial warehouse buildings (39-year property) are real property and must use the mid-month convention. Land improvements such as parking lots (15-year property) also typically use the half-year convention since they're not classified as real property buildings. The key distinction is that the half-year convention is the default for personal property—tangible assets like equipment, furniture, fixtures, and machinery—while the mid-month convention is required for real property buildings with 27.5-year and 39-year recovery periods.

## Question 3
What does the "40% test" determine in relation to depreciation conventions?

A) The minimum percentage of an asset's cost that must be depreciated in the first year
B) Whether the mid-quarter convention must be used instead of the half-year convention
C) The threshold for bonus depreciation eligibility
D) The maximum depreciation rate allowed under MACRS

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The "40% test" (also called the "last quarter rule") determines whether the mid-quarter convention must be used instead of the half-year convention for personal property. Specifically, if more than 40% of the year's total personal property additions (measured by cost basis, not count) are placed in service during the last three months of the tax year (October, November, December), then the mid-quarter convention applies to ALL personal property placed in service during that tax year. This rule prevents taxpayers from gaming the system by concentrating asset purchases late in the year to maximize first-year depreciation under the half-year convention. It's important to note that the test requires MORE than 40%—exactly 40% does not trigger the mid-quarter convention.

## Question 4
A business purchases $800,000 of equipment during 2025: $300,000 in February, $200,000 in June, and $300,000 in October. Does this trigger the mid-quarter convention?

A) Yes, because equipment was purchased in October (Q4)
B) No, because the mid-quarter convention never applies to equipment
C) No, because only 37.5% ($300,000 ÷ $800,000) was placed in service in Q4, which does not exceed 40%
D) Yes, because more than $250,000 was purchased in Q4

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: The mid-quarter convention is NOT triggered because only 37.5% of the year's personal property ($300,000 out of $800,000 total) was placed in service in the fourth quarter (October-December). The rule requires MORE than 40% to be placed in service in Q4 to trigger the mid-quarter convention. Since 37.5% is below the 40% threshold, the half-year convention applies to all equipment purchased during 2025. This means all three purchases—whether made in February, June, or October—receive the same 6 months (half-year) of depreciation in 2025. It's important to calculate the percentage based on total cost basis of all personal property placed in service during the year, not the absolute dollar amount.

## Question 5
What happens in the year of disposition under the half-year convention?

A) A full year of depreciation is allowed because the asset was disposed of
B) Half a year of depreciation is allowed, regardless of when during the year the asset is disposed of
C) No depreciation is allowed in the year of disposition
D) Depreciation is calculated based on the actual number of months the asset was in service

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the half-year convention, half a year of depreciation is allowed in the year of disposition, regardless of when during the year the asset is actually disposed of. This mirrors the treatment in the acquisition year—whether you sell, retire, or dispose of the asset on January 2 or December 30, you receive exactly 6 months (half a year) of depreciation in that final year. This symmetry simplifies depreciation calculations and record-keeping. For example, if you purchased equipment in 2020 and disposed of it on March 1, 2025, you would receive half a year of depreciation in both 2020 (acquisition year) and 2025 (disposition year), with full years of depreciation for 2021-2024.

## Question 6
A company purchased $1,000,000 of equipment in 2025: $400,000 in March, $200,000 in August, and $400,000 in November. They want to purchase an additional $100,000 of equipment in December. Should they proceed or wait until January 2026 to avoid triggering the mid-quarter convention?

A) Proceed with the December purchase—it won't trigger mid-quarter
B) Wait until January 2026—the December purchase would push Q4 to exactly 40%, not triggering mid-quarter
C) Wait until January 2026—the December purchase would make Q4 = 45.45%, exceeding 40% and triggering mid-quarter for all 2025 equipment
D) It doesn't matter because mid-quarter only applies to real property

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: They should wait until January 2026. With the additional December purchase, Q4 equipment would total $500,000 ($400,000 already in November + $100,000 new December purchase) out of $1,100,000 total for the year, which equals 45.45%. Since this exceeds the 40% threshold, the mid-quarter convention would be triggered for ALL personal property placed in service in 2025. This would significantly reduce first-year depreciation for the $400,000 purchased in March and the $200,000 purchased in August, as they would only receive 1.5 months and 4.5 months of depreciation respectively under mid-quarter (versus 6 months each under half-year). By waiting until January 2026 for the $100,000 purchase, the company keeps Q4 at exactly 40% ($400,000 ÷ $1,000,000), avoiding the mid-quarter trigger and maximizing 2025 depreciation under the half-year convention. This is a classic tax planning strategy around year-end.

## Question 7
A taxpayer purchases manufacturing equipment (7-year property) on January 15, 2025 for $200,000. Assuming the half-year convention applies and no bonus depreciation is elected, what is the first-year MACRS depreciation deduction using the 200% declining balance method?

A) $200,000 × (2/7) = $57,143 (full year calculation)
B) $200,000 × (2/7) × 0.5 = $28,571.50 (half-year applied)
C) $200,000 × 14.29% = $28,580 (using IRS MACRS table rate for 7-year, year 1, half-year convention)
D) Either B or C—both are correct approaches

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: D ✓
**Explanation**: Both approaches B and C are correct and arrive at essentially the same answer (with minor rounding differences). Method B calculates the depreciation manually: the 200% declining balance rate for 7-year property is 2/7 (or 28.57%), and applying the half-year convention multiplies by 0.5, yielding $28,571.50. Method C uses the IRS MACRS depreciation tables (Publication 946), which have the half-year convention and automatic switch to straight-line already built into the published percentages. For 7-year property in year 1 under the half-year convention, the table rate is 14.29%, giving $28,580. The slight difference ($8.50) is due to rounding in the published tables. In practice, most taxpayers and tax software use the IRS tables (Method C) for simplicity and consistency, but understanding the manual calculation (Method B) demonstrates comprehension of how the half-year convention works.

## Question 8
Under the mid-quarter convention, when are assets placed in the first quarter (January-March) assumed to be placed in service?

A) January 1
B) Mid-February (approximately 1.5 months into the year)
C) March 31
D) June 30 (mid-year, same as half-year convention)

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Under the mid-quarter convention, assets placed in service during the first quarter (January-March) are assumed to be placed in service at the mid-point of that quarter, which is mid-February (approximately February 15). This means that Q1 assets receive approximately 10.5 months of depreciation in the first year (from mid-February through December 31). Similarly, Q2 assets are treated as placed in service mid-May (7.5 months depreciation), Q3 assets mid-August (4.5 months), and Q4 assets mid-November (1.5 months). Notice that when the mid-quarter convention applies, assets placed earlier in the year receive MORE first-year depreciation than those placed later, which is the opposite incentive from the half-year convention where timing doesn't matter. This is why triggering the mid-quarter convention can be disadvantageous—it penalizes early-year purchases.

## Question 9
A real estate developer purchases a commercial building on November 1, 2025, and immediately conducts a cost segregation study identifying $2 million in personal property (5-year, 7-year, and 15-year assets). The developer also purchases $1.5 million of manufacturing equipment throughout the year: $500,000 in March, $400,000 in July, and $600,000 in October. How do the depreciation conventions apply to these assets, and what planning considerations should be addressed?

A) All assets use half-year convention since the total exceeds the mid-quarter threshold
B) The building uses mid-month convention; the $2M personal property from cost segregation uses half-year convention; but the $600,000 equipment purchase in October triggers mid-quarter for ALL personal property (both cost seg and separate equipment)
C) The building uses mid-month convention; all personal property uses half-year convention because real estate is excluded from the 40% test
D) Each category uses its own convention independently

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is a sophisticated multi-layered scenario. The 39-year commercial building structure uses the mid-month convention (required for all 27.5 and 39-year real property). For the personal property, we must test ALL personal property placed in service during 2025 against the 40% threshold—this includes BOTH the $2 million identified through cost segregation (treated as placed in service on November 1 with the building) AND the $1.5 million of separately purchased equipment. Total personal property = $3.5 million. Q4 personal property = $2M (cost seg, November) + $600K (equipment, October) = $2.6M. The percentage is $2.6M ÷ $3.5M = 74.3%, which far exceeds 40%. Therefore, the mid-quarter convention applies to ALL personal property placed in service in 2025, including both the cost segregation assets and the separately purchased equipment. This demonstrates why timing matters in cost segregation studies—conducting the study on a building acquired late in the year can inadvertently trigger mid-quarter for all personal property.

## Question 10
A tax strategist is advising a client with multiple real estate acquisitions planned for 2025. The client will purchase buildings in February, June, and November, and will conduct cost segregation studies on each. The strategist suggests either: (1) completing all three cost segregation studies in 2025, or (2) deferring the November building's cost segregation study to 2026. Evaluate the strategic implications of timing the cost segregation studies, considering the 40% test, first-year depreciation optimization, and compliance requirements under current OBBBA 2025 bonus depreciation rules.

A) Always defer cost segregation studies to future years to avoid triggering mid-quarter convention
B) Complete all studies in 2025; mid-quarter isn't a concern because 100% bonus depreciation under OBBBA 2025 makes convention differences irrelevant for qualifying property
C) Analyze the specific dollar amounts: if the November building's personal property would push Q4 over 40%, consider deferring that study to 2026 via Form 3115, though this delays tax benefits; alternatively, if amounts are manageable or 100% bonus applies, proceed with all studies in 2025
D) Cost segregation studies cannot be deferred—they must be completed in the year of acquisition

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This is the sophisticated, nuanced strategic analysis that professional advisors should employ. The key is to analyze the specific dollar amounts involved—if completing the November building's cost segregation study would cause Q4 personal property to exceed 40% of the year's total, the strategist should weigh the trade-offs. Option 1 (defer to 2026 using Form 3115) avoids mid-quarter for 2025 but delays tax benefits by a year. Option 2 (complete all in 2025) maximizes immediate benefits but might trigger mid-quarter. However, with OBBBA 2025's permanent 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying property placed in service after January 19, 2025, the mid-quarter concern is significantly mitigated since bonus-eligible assets receive immediate full expensing regardless of convention. The strategic decision depends on: (1) whether all personal property qualifies for bonus, (2) whether the client might elect out of bonus, (3) the specific dollar amounts that would determine mid-quarter triggering, and (4) the client's overall tax situation. This demonstrates that tax strategy requires case-by-case analysis rather than blanket rules.
