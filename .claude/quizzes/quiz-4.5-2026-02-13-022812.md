## Question 1
Under the tangible property regulations, what are the TWO threshold criteria that allow a Unit of Property to be expensed as materials and supplies (M&S)?

A) Economic useful life of 24 months or less OR unit cost of $100 or less
B) Economic useful life of 12 months or less OR unit cost of $200 or less
C) Economic useful life of 12 months or less OR unit cost of $500 or less
D) Economic useful life of 18 months or less OR unit cost of $250 or less

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Under the tangible property regulations, a Unit of Property can be expensed as materials and supplies if it meets EITHER of these two criteria: (1) its economic useful life is **12 months or less**, OR (2) the unit cost is **$200 or less**. The regulations increased the threshold from $100 to $200 in the final tangible property regulations. Only one criterion needs to be met - these are alternative tests, not both required. This is a fundamental threshold that simplifies the treatment of small-cost items and short-lived property in cost segregation work.

## Question 2
Which of the following is NOT one of the four categories of materials and supplies defined in the tangible property regulations?

A) Components acquired to maintain, repair, or improve a Unit of Property
B) Fuel, lubricants, water, and similar consumable items
C) Property with economic useful life of 12 months or less
D) Inventory held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: D ✓
**Explanation**: Inventory held for sale to customers is NOT one of the four categories of materials and supplies. The tangible property regulations specifically define materials and supplies as "tangible, non-inventory property." The four actual categories of materials and supplies are: (1) components acquired to maintain, repair, or improve a Unit of Property, (2) fuel, lubricants, water, and similar consumable items, (3) property with economic useful life of 12 months or less, and (4) property with acquisition or production cost of $200 or less. Inventory is excluded from the M&S definition because it's held for sale rather than for use in operations.

## Question 3
What are "rotable spare parts" as defined in the tangible property regulations?

A) Parts that can only be used once and must be replaced after installation
B) Parts acquired for installation on a UOP that are removable, generally repaired, and reinstalled or stored for later installation
C) Parts that rotate mechanically as part of their normal operation
D) Parts that must be rotated between different properties to maintain compliance

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Rotable spare parts are specifically defined in the tangible property regulations as parts that are (1) acquired for installation on a Unit of Property, (2) removable from the UOP, (3) generally repaired and either reinstalled on the same or different property or stored for later installation, and (4) used as temporary or standby emergency spare parts. The term "rotable" refers to the parts being rotated in and out of service (removed, repaired, reinstalled), not to mechanical rotation. Common examples include aircraft engines, industrial pump components, and heavy equipment parts that can be swapped out, refurbished, and reused. Understanding rotable spare parts is important in cost segregation because they have special capitalization and depreciation treatment.

## Question 4
A manufacturing facility purchases 100 replacement light bulbs at $15 each for a total cost of $1,500. The bulbs have an estimated useful life of 18 months each. How should this expenditure be treated under the materials and supplies rules?

A) Must be capitalized because the total purchase exceeds $200
B) Can be expensed as materials and supplies because each bulb's unit cost is $15 (under $200)
C) Must be capitalized because the useful life exceeds 12 months
D) Can only be expensed if the taxpayer makes a de minimis safe harbor election

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The materials and supplies test applies on a per-unit basis, not a total purchase basis. Since each individual light bulb costs $15, which is well under the $200 unit cost threshold, the bulbs qualify as materials and supplies and can be expensed immediately. It doesn't matter that (1) the total purchase is $1,500, or (2) the useful life is 18 months (exceeding the 12-month threshold). Remember, the M&S rules use "OR" logic - a property qualifies if EITHER the unit cost is $200 or less OR the useful life is 12 months or less. Only one criterion needs to be met. This is separate from and more generous than the de minimis safe harbor, which has different thresholds ($500 or $2,500 depending on whether you have an applicable financial statement). In cost segregation work, properly identifying M&S can provide immediate expensing for many small components.

## Question 5
A hotel purchases specialized HVAC filters for $180 each with an expected useful life of 24 months, and also purchases cleaning supplies (mops, buckets, etc.) for $50 each with an expected useful life of 36 months. How should these be treated?

A) Both must be capitalized because both have useful lives exceeding 12 months
B) Both can be expensed as M&S because both have unit costs under $200
C) Only the filters can be expensed (under $200); cleaning supplies must be capitalized
D) Only the cleaning supplies can be expensed (lower cost); filters must be capitalized

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Both items can be expensed as materials and supplies because both meet the unit cost threshold of $200 or less. The HVAC filters cost $180 each and the cleaning supplies cost $50 each - both are under the $200 threshold. The fact that both have useful lives exceeding 12 months is irrelevant because the M&S criteria use "OR" logic, not "AND" logic. A property qualifies as M&S if it meets EITHER criterion: (1) useful life of 12 months or less, OR (2) unit cost of $200 or less. In this case, neither item meets the 12-month criterion, but both meet the $200 unit cost criterion, so both qualify for immediate expensing as materials and supplies. This demonstrates why the $200 threshold is so valuable - it allows expensing of many routine operational items regardless of their useful life.

## Question 6
A cost segregation professional is analyzing a client's building renovation. The client purchased replacement ceiling tiles at $150 per box (with 12 tiles per box, so $12.50 per tile) and wants to expense them as materials and supplies. How should the professional apply the $200 threshold?

A) Apply the test to the total project cost for all ceiling tiles combined
B) Apply the test per box ($150), so the tiles qualify as M&S
C) Apply the test per individual tile ($12.50), so the tiles qualify as M&S
D) Ceiling tiles are always part of the building structure and cannot be M&S regardless of cost

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The $200 threshold for materials and supplies should be applied per individual functional unit, not per packaging or purchase unit. While the ceiling tiles are purchased in boxes of 12 for $150 per box, each individual tile is the relevant "unit" for the M&S test because: (1) each tile can be installed separately, (2) each tile can be replaced independently, and (3) each tile is a distinct functional component. At $12.50 per tile, they clearly qualify as materials and supplies. Although applying the test per box ($150) would also result in M&S qualification in this case, that's not the technically correct methodology. In cost segregation work, applying the M&S test at the proper unit level is important - you look at the smallest functional component that can be independently installed, used, or replaced. The box is just packaging; the tile is the actual unit of property being acquired and installed.

## Question 7
A warehouse purchases emergency backup pump parts to keep on hand in case the primary water pump system fails. These rotable spare parts cost $8,000 total. The parts can be installed, removed, repaired, and reinstalled multiple times. How should these rotable spare parts be treated for tax purposes?

A) Immediately expensed as materials and supplies under the $200 threshold
B) Capitalized and depreciated when placed in service (installed on the pump system)
C) Must be capitalized immediately upon purchase regardless of installation
D) Treated as inventory and expensed only when sold

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Rotable spare parts have special treatment under the tangible property regulations. While they are technically classified as a category of materials and supplies, they are NOT immediately deductible upon purchase. Instead, rotable spare parts are capitalized and depreciation begins when they are first placed in service - meaning when they are initially installed on the Unit of Property. This is different from other M&S categories that may be deducted when used or consumed. The rationale is that rotable parts (which can be removed, repaired, and reinstalled multiple times) are more like capitalized assets than consumable supplies. Answer A is incorrect because the $200 threshold wouldn't apply to these high-value parts. Answer C is incorrect because capitalization occurs at installation, not purchase. Answer D is incorrect because these are operational assets, not inventory held for sale. Understanding the timing of capitalization for rotable spare parts is important in cost segregation because it affects when depreciation deductions begin.

## Question 8
A cost segregation professional is advising a client who operates a chain of retail stores. The client routinely purchases various items: (1) promotional signage at $75 each with 6-month useful life, (2) shelving brackets at $15 each with 5-year useful life, (3) specialty display cases at $3,500 each with 10-year useful life, and (4) LED exit signs at $250 each with 15-year useful life. Which items qualify as materials and supplies that can be immediately expensed?

A) Only items 1 and 2 (both under $200)
B) Items 1, 2, and 4 (all under or at the thresholds)
C) Items 1 and 2 (meet either the cost or useful life threshold)
D) Only item 1 (the only one meeting the 12-month useful life test)

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: Items 1 and 2 qualify as materials and supplies and can be immediately expensed. Item 1 (promotional signage at $75, 6-month life) qualifies under BOTH criteria - it's under $200 AND has a useful life under 12 months. Item 2 (shelving brackets at $15, 5-year life) qualifies under the unit cost criterion even though it fails the useful life test. Item 3 (display cases at $3,500) fails both tests - too expensive and too long-lived. Item 4 (LED exit signs at $250) also fails both tests - $250 exceeds the $200 threshold AND the 15-year life exceeds 12 months. While Answer A correctly identifies items 1 and 2, Answer C is better because it explicitly acknowledges the "either/or" logic of the M&S test - items qualify if they meet EITHER the cost OR the useful life threshold. This demonstrates complete understanding of how the M&S rules work, which is essential for cost segregation professionals advising clients on which expenditures can be immediately expensed.

## Question 9
A cost segregation study is being performed on a mixed-use building (retail and office). The professional identifies the following expenditures during a recent renovation: (1) $50,000 for new HVAC filters with 18-month useful life and $180 unit cost, (2) $75,000 for specialty lighting fixtures at $400 each with 10-year useful life, (3) $25,000 for janitorial supplies at $30 per unit with 24-month useful life, and (4) $100,000 for a new elevator system. Considering the materials and supplies rules, de minimis safe harbor (assuming $500 threshold without AFS), and standard capitalization requirements, which approach maximizes the current-year deduction while maintaining compliance?

A) Expense all items under M&S rules since they're all operational supplies
B) Expense items 1 and 3 under M&S rules; capitalize items 2 and 4 but perform cost segregation on them to identify shorter-lived components
C) Use de minimis safe harbor for items 1, 2, and 3; capitalize only item 4
D) Capitalize all items to avoid audit risk and claim maximum depreciation

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This synthesis question requires integrating multiple tax concepts. The most compliant and strategically sound approach is: (1) Expense items 1 and 3 under M&S rules - the HVAC filters ($180 unit cost) and janitorial supplies ($30 unit cost) both qualify since they're under the $200 threshold, providing immediate deduction of $75,000; (2) Capitalize items 2 and 4 - the lighting fixtures ($400 each, exceeding $200 and 12-month thresholds) and elevator system must be capitalized; (3) Perform cost segregation on the capitalized items to identify components with shorter recovery periods (5, 7, or 15-year property vs. 39-year building property), maximizing accelerated depreciation. While Answer C suggests using de minimis safe harbor for the lighting fixtures, this is unnecessarily complex when M&S rules already provide clear treatment for items 1 and 3. Answer B demonstrates proper professional judgment: use the most straightforward rule for what clearly qualifies (M&S), capitalize what must be capitalized, and optimize the capitalized amounts through cost segregation. This approach maximizes current-year benefits while maintaining full compliance and audit defensibility.

## Question 10
A cost segregation professional is reviewing a client's historical treatment of various property acquisitions. The client has been inconsistently applying the materials and supplies rules, sometimes using the $200 threshold and other times using an old $100 threshold from outdated guidance. The client also has rotable spare parts that were immediately expensed rather than capitalized when placed in service. What should the professional recommend regarding correction of these errors and ongoing compliance?

A) File amended returns for all open years to correct the errors and implement proper M&S procedures going forward
B) Ignore past errors to avoid audit exposure; implement correct procedures only for future years
C) File Form 3115 (change in accounting method) to correct the treatment prospectively with a Section 481(a) adjustment, and implement proper M&S procedures including the current $200 threshold
D) Capitalize all M&S items going forward to ensure future compliance, even if they qualify for immediate expensing

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: This synthesis question tests understanding of how to properly correct systematic accounting method errors in the context of materials and supplies. When a taxpayer has been using an incorrect accounting method (such as using the outdated $100 threshold instead of the current $200 threshold, or immediately expensing rotable spare parts instead of capitalizing them when placed in service), the proper IRS-approved correction mechanism is Form 3115 - Application for Change in Accounting Method. This form allows the taxpayer to: (1) change to the correct method prospectively (going forward), (2) include a Section 481(a) adjustment that accounts for the cumulative effect of the change in prior years (catching up for past errors in one adjustment rather than amending multiple returns), and (3) comply with IRS procedures for accounting method changes. Answer A (amended returns) is less efficient and not the standard approach for systematic method errors. Answer B (ignoring errors) violates professional ethics and compliance obligations. Answer D (over-capitalizing) unnecessarily forfeits legitimate tax benefits. This demonstrates how cost segregation professionals must understand not just current rules, but also how to properly correct past errors when reviewing client situations.
