## Question 1
The routine maintenance safe harbor for buildings applies to activities the taxpayer reasonably expects to perform more than once in how many years?

A) 5 years
B) 7 years
C) 10 years
D) 15 years

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The routine maintenance safe harbor for buildings applies to activities that the taxpayer reasonably expects to perform **more than once in 10 years**. This is specifically for buildings - for other property, it's based on performing the activity more than once during the asset's class life. The 10-year rule for buildings is a key distinction to remember. Activities like carpet replacement every 7-8 years or painting every 5-7 years would qualify under this safe harbor.

## Question 2
A taxpayer without an Applicable Financial Statement (AFS) wants to utilize the de minimis safe harbor. What is the maximum amount per invoice line item they can expense?

A) $1,000
B) $2,500
C) $5,000
D) $10,000

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: For taxpayers **without** an Applicable Financial Statement (AFS), the de minimis safe harbor threshold is **$2,500** per invoice line item. Taxpayers **with** AFS can expense up to $5,000 per line item. You may be thinking of the $10,000 threshold from the safe harbor for small taxpayers, which is a different safe harbor with different requirements. Remember: no AFS = $2,500, with AFS = $5,000.

## Question 3
Which statement is TRUE about the written accounting policy requirement for the de minimis safe harbor?

A) The policy can be adopted at any time during the tax year
B) The policy must be in place at the beginning of the tax year
C) The policy is optional if you have an AFS
D) The policy can be established retroactively when filing the tax return

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: A critical requirement for the de minimis safe harbor is that the written accounting policy **must be in place at the beginning of the tax year**. This is a mandatory timing requirement - you cannot adopt it mid-year or retroactively when filing your return. This advance planning requirement distinguishes the de minimis safe harbor from some other elections and makes it less flexible, but provides certainty for tax planning purposes.

## Question 4
A building owner has average gross receipts of $9 million, a building with an unadjusted basis of $600,000, and spent $15,000 on repairs this year. Under the safe harbor for small taxpayers, how much can they expense?

A) $15,000 - the full amount since they meet the gross receipts test
B) $12,000 - 2% of the building's unadjusted basis
C) $10,000 - the lesser of $10,000 or 2% of basis
D) $0 - they don't qualify because their costs exceed the threshold

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: D ✗
**Explanation**: This is a critical point about the safe harbor for small taxpayers - it's an **all-or-nothing election**. The threshold is the lesser of $10,000 or 2% of the building's unadjusted basis. Here, 2% of $600,000 = $12,000, so the threshold is $10,000 (the lesser amount). Since their actual costs of $15,000 **exceed** this $10,000 threshold, they **do not qualify** for the safe harbor at all and cannot expense any amount under this provision. The entire $15,000 must be analyzed under normal capitalization rules (BAR tests, etc.). You cannot partially apply this safe harbor up to the threshold - it's either all or nothing.

## Question 5
A taxpayer replaces a building's roof every 25 years. The building has a 39-year class life. Does this activity qualify for the routine maintenance safe harbor?

A) Yes, because it's performed more than once during the building's class life
B) No, because it's not performed more than once in 10 years
C) Yes, because the building has a class life over 20 years
D) No, because roofs must always be capitalized

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: A ✗
**Explanation**: The routine maintenance safe harbor has **two alternative tests** - you only need to meet ONE of them:

1. Performed more than once during the asset's class life, **OR**
2. Performed more than once in 10 years (for buildings)

In this case, the roof replacement every 25 years fails the "more than once in 10 years" test, BUT it **passes** the first test: the building has a 39-year class life, and the roof is replaced every 25 years, meaning it would be replaced at least once (and partially into a second time) during the building's class life (39 ÷ 25 = 1.56 times). Since it meets the first test, the activity qualifies for the routine maintenance safe harbor. Remember: it's "OR" not "AND" - you only need to satisfy one condition.

## Question 6
A landlord with gross receipts of $8 million owns a building with a $750,000 unadjusted basis. They spent $9,500 on qualifying repairs. If they elect the safe harbor for small taxpayers, what happens?

A) They can expense the full $9,500 because it's under the $10,000 threshold
B) They can only expense $7,500 (1% of building basis)
C) They must capitalize everything because they didn't file Form 3115
D) They can expense $9,500 but must attach an election statement to their return

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: A ✗
**Explanation**: Let's check if they qualify for the safe harbor for small taxpayers:
- ✓ Gross receipts of $8 million (under $10 million limit)
- ✓ Building basis of $750,000 (under $1 million limit)
- ✓ Repair costs of $9,500 are under the threshold (lesser of $10,000 or 2% × $750,000 = $15,000, so threshold is $10,000)

Since they meet all three criteria and the costs are under the $10,000 threshold, they can **expense the full $9,500**. While an election statement must be attached to use this safe harbor, the question states "if they elect," meaning the election is already being made. The key point is that they qualify and can expense the entire amount - not just a partial amount. Answer D incorrectly suggests additional requirements beyond what the question asks.

## Question 7
A property owner has $11,000 in annual building repairs. The repairs consist of: $4,000 HVAC maintenance (done every 4 years), $3,500 painting (done every 6 years), $2,000 in supplies at $150 each, and $1,500 plumbing repairs (one-time issue). The building has a $900,000 unadjusted basis and gross receipts are $8 million. How can these be optimally treated?

A) Use small taxpayer safe harbor for everything
B) Use routine maintenance for HVAC and painting ($7,500), de minimis for supplies ($2,000), capitalize plumbing ($1,500)
C) Capitalize everything because total exceeds $10,000
D) Use de minimis for all items since each is under $5,000

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is an excellent example of strategically combining multiple safe harbors - exactly what you missed on Question 10 of your previous quiz! Let's break it down:

**Small taxpayer safe harbor doesn't work:** Total costs ($11,000) exceed the threshold of $10,000 (lesser of $10,000 or 2% × $900,000).

**Optimal strategy - apply different safe harbors to different expenses:**
- **Routine maintenance safe harbor:** HVAC (every 4 years) and painting (every 6 years) both qualify as activities performed more than once in 10 years → expense $7,500
- **De minimis safe harbor:** Supplies at $150 each are well under the $2,500/$5,000 thresholds when applied per item → expense $2,000
- **Plumbing repairs:** One-time issue doesn't qualify for routine maintenance, would need BAR analysis → likely capitalize $1,500

By analyzing each expenditure individually and applying the most appropriate safe harbor, you can expense $9,500 of the $11,000 immediately, rather than defaulting to capitalization. Great job!

## Question 8
Why does the de minimis safe harbor require a written accounting policy to be established at the beginning of the tax year, while the routine maintenance safe harbor does not?

A) The de minimis safe harbor involves dollar thresholds that must be consistently applied
B) Routine maintenance decisions can be made on a case-by-case basis each year
C) The IRS wants to prevent retroactive classification of expenses as de minimis
D) All of the above

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: D ✓
**Explanation**: All three reasons explain the policy timing requirement for the de minimis safe harbor:

**A is correct:** The de minimis safe harbor involves specific dollar thresholds ($2,500 or $5,000) that must be consistently applied throughout the year. A written policy ensures this consistency.

**B is correct:** Routine maintenance is based on objective facts - whether the activity is reasonably expected to be performed more than once during the asset's class life (or more than once in 10 years for buildings). This is a factual determination that doesn't require advance planning.

**C is correct:** Requiring the policy to be in place at the beginning of the tax year prevents abuse - taxpayers can't wait until year-end to see what they spent and then retroactively adopt a de minimis policy to expense those items.

This advance planning requirement is a key strategic difference between the de minimis safe harbor (planning required) and routine maintenance safe harbor (factual determination).

## Question 9
A cost segregation professional advises a client with a $950,000 building and $9 million in gross receipts. The client has $8,000 in qualifying repairs this year. Next year, they expect $15,000 in repairs. How should the professional advise the client regarding the safe harbor for small taxpayers?

A) Elect the safe harbor both years since the building qualifies
B) Elect in year 1 only, since year 2 exceeds the $10,000 threshold
C) Don't elect either year to maintain flexibility
D) Elect in year 2 only to maximize the benefit

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: The safe harbor for small taxpayers is an **annual election** that must be evaluated each year based on that year's costs. Let's analyze both years:

**Year 1:**
- Building basis: $950K ✓, Gross receipts: $9M ✓
- Costs: $8,000
- Threshold: Lesser of $10,000 or 2% × $950,000 = $10,000
- $8,000 < $10,000 ✓ **Qualifies - should elect**

**Year 2:**
- Building basis: $950K ✓, Gross receipts: $9M ✓
- Costs: $15,000
- Threshold: $10,000 (same calculation)
- $15,000 > $10,000 ✗ **Does NOT qualify**

Even though the building and gross receipts qualify both years, the client can only use the safe harbor in Year 1 because Year 2's costs ($15,000) exceed the $10,000 threshold. In Year 2, they would need to use the BAR tests or other safe harbors (like routine maintenance) for individual expenses. This demonstrates why the safe harbor must be evaluated annually based on actual costs.

## Question 10
As bonus depreciation phases out (0% by 2027 under pre-OBBBA law), a landlord asks whether to establish a de minimis safe harbor policy. They typically have $3,000-4,000 in annual small repairs. What is the BEST strategic advice?

A) Don't adopt it - the amounts are too small to matter
B) Adopt it now - immediate expensing becomes more valuable as bonus disappears
C) Wait until bonus fully phases out in 2027
D) Only adopt it in years with higher repair costs

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is a critical strategic insight for cost segregation planning! As bonus depreciation phases out, the difference between immediate expensing and capitalizing becomes much more significant:

**When bonus was 100%:** Capitalizing small items still provided immediate tax benefits through bonus depreciation.

**As bonus phases out (60% → 40% → 20% → 0%):** Capitalized items must increasingly be depreciated over their full recovery periods (5, 7, 15, or 39 years), making immediate expensing through safe harbors much more valuable.

**Why adopt now:**
1. **Increasing value:** The de minimis safe harbor becomes more valuable each year as bonus decreases
2. **Timing requirement:** The policy must be in place at the **beginning** of the tax year, so adopting it now provides flexibility
3. **Consistent benefit:** Even "small" amounts ($3,000-4,000) add up, and immediate expensing is better than multi-year depreciation

This is exactly the type of proactive tax planning cost segregation professionals should be advising clients on as the tax landscape changes.
