## Question 4
A cost segregation practitioner is analyzing a commercial office building. The primary objective is to reclassify certain building components into shorter recovery periods. Which reclassification would yield the greatest acceleration of depreciation?

A) Moving carpet from 39-year to 15-year property
B) Moving parking lot paving from 39-year to 15-year property
C) Moving decorative lighting from 39-year to 5-year property
D) Moving office furniture from 15-year to 7-year property

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The greatest acceleration comes from moving an asset from the longest recovery period to the shortest. Reclassifying from 39 years to 5 years provides the largest difference (34 years). Carpet is also 5-year property, and parking lots are 15-year land improvements.

## Question 5
An apartment complex generates 85% of its gross revenue from dwelling units and 15% from a ground-floor retail space. How should this property be classified for MACRS purposes?

A) 39-year non-residential real property because it contains commercial space
B) 27.5-year residential rental property because 80%+ of revenue is residential
C) Split classification: residential portion at 27.5 years, commercial at 39 years
D) 31.5-year property as a mixed-use building

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: Under MACRS, the 80% test determines the classification of the entire building. If 80% or more of gross rental income is from dwelling units, the entire building qualifies as residential rental property with a 27.5-year recovery period.

## Question 6
A taxpayer filed their 2023 and 2024 returns using a particular depreciation method for a newly acquired asset. They now want to change the method for 2025. What is required?

A) They can freely change the method since only two years have passed
B) They must file an amended return for 2023 before changing the method
C) They must obtain IRS approval to change the method because it is considered "established"
D) They can change the method by simply electing a different one on the 2025 return

## Question 7
A client purchased a commercial warehouse 3 years ago and has been depreciating the entire building over 39 years. A cost segregation study identifies the parking lot ($200,000) as 15-year property. What is the significance of reclassifying this component?

A) The parking lot uses straight-line depreciation over 15 years, providing modest acceleration
B) The parking lot uses 150% declining balance over 15 years, providing both a shorter life and accelerated method
C) The parking lot must remain at 39 years since the method is already established
D) The parking lot is reclassified to 7-year property as a land improvement

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Land improvements like parking lots are 15-year property using 150% declining balance under GDS, providing a double benefit: shorter recovery period and an accelerated depreciation method.

## Question 8
Under the MACRS General Depreciation System (GDS), which combination of recovery period and depreciation method is correct for personal property classified as 7-year property?

B) 7 years, 150% declining balance
C) 7 years, 200% declining balance
D) 10 years, 200% declining balance

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Under GDS, 5-year and 7-year personal property uses the 200% declining balance method. 15-year land improvements use 150% declining balance, and real property uses straight-line.

## Question 10
A taxpayer is deciding whether to conduct a cost segregation study on a newly acquired $10 million commercial office building placed in service in 2025. They have not yet filed a tax return. Why is conducting the study now strategically advantageous?

A) The study must be completed before the building is placed in service to be valid
B) Filing with proper classifications from the start avoids the need for a change in accounting method (Form 3115) later
C) The IRS only allows cost segregation studies within the first year of ownership
D) Bonus depreciation is only available if the study is completed before the first tax return is filed

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: By completing the study before filing the first return, the taxpayer can classify assets correctly from the outset, avoiding the complexity of a later accounting method change via Form 3115. Studies can be done at any time, and bonus depreciation can be claimed retroactively.
