## Question 1
What is the primary purpose of IRS Form 3115 in the context of cost segregation studies?

A) To request an extension for filing the tax return
B) To apply for a change in accounting method for property placed in service in prior years
C) To amend prior-year tax returns for missed depreciation
D) To request a refund for overpaid taxes

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, is the IRS form required when conducting a cost segregation study on property placed in service in prior years (a "look-back" study). This form allows taxpayers to change their depreciation method and claim missed depreciation through a Section 481(a) adjustment. Importantly, Form 3115 eliminates the need to amend prior-year returns—the catch-up depreciation is taken in the current year, providing immediate tax benefits. The form is filed with the current year's tax return and, for most cost segregation changes, qualifies for automatic IRS consent with no user fee required.

## Question 2
What is a Section 481(a) adjustment in the context of Form 3115 and cost segregation studies?

A) A penalty imposed by the IRS for late filing of depreciation schedules
B) The catch-up depreciation representing the difference between what should have been claimed and what was actually claimed in prior years
C) An adjustment to increase the property's cost basis for inflation
D) A requirement to spread missed depreciation over the remaining recovery period

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: The Section 481(a) adjustment is the "catch-up" depreciation amount that represents the cumulative difference between the depreciation that should have been claimed under the new (correct) method and what was actually claimed under the old method in all prior years. This adjustment is a critical benefit of Form 3115 because it allows taxpayers to claim the entire catch-up amount in the current tax year rather than having to amend prior-year returns. For cost segregation studies, the 481(a) adjustment can be substantial—often hundreds of thousands of dollars—as it captures all the accelerated depreciation that was missed when assets were incorrectly classified as part of the building structure. The adjustment prevents both double-deduction and omission of income during accounting method changes, ensuring accurate tax treatment going forward.

## Question 3
Which of the following statements is TRUE about the automatic consent procedures for Form 3115 in cost segregation changes?

A) A user fee of $7,500 is required for all automatic consent changes
B) Taxpayers must wait for advance IRS approval before implementing the change
C) No user fee is required and no advance IRS approval is needed if procedural requirements are met
D) Automatic consent is only available for properties acquired in the current tax year

**Your Answer**: C
**Correct Answer**: C ✓
**Explanation**: Most cost segregation-related accounting method changes qualify for automatic IRS consent procedures, which significantly simplifies the process. Under automatic consent, no user fee is required and no advance IRS approval is needed, as long as the taxpayer meets the specific procedural requirements outlined in IRS Revenue Procedure guidance. The form is simply filed with the taxpayer's timely-filed tax return (including extensions). For cost segregation, the designated change numbers (DCN) are DCN 7 for residential rental property and DCN 196 for nonresidential real property. This automatic consent procedure makes it much easier and more cost-effective for taxpayers to correct their depreciation treatment, as opposed to non-automatic changes which would require a $9,500+ user fee and advance IRS review.

## Question 4
A taxpayer purchased a commercial building in 2020 and has been depreciating it entirely as 39-year nonresidential real property. In 2025, they conduct a cost segregation study identifying $800,000 in personal property that should have been depreciated over 5, 7, and 15 years. What is the primary filing requirement to capture the missed depreciation?

A) Amend tax returns for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 to correct the depreciation schedules
B) File Form 3115 with the 2025 tax return showing a Section 481(a) adjustment for the catch-up depreciation
C) Wait until the building is sold to recapture the missed depreciation through Section 1245 treatment
D) File a claim for refund on Form 1040-X for each prior year separately

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: When conducting a cost segregation study on property placed in service in a prior year (a "look-back" study), the taxpayer must file Form 3115 with their current year's tax return (2025 in this case). The Section 481(a) adjustment on Form 3115 captures all the missed depreciation from prior years—calculated as the difference between what should have been claimed using the correct method (segregated assets) and what was actually claimed (all 39-year depreciation). One of the key benefits of Form 3115 is that it eliminates the need to amend prior-year returns—the entire catch-up depreciation is taken in the current year, providing immediate tax benefit. For this scenario, assuming the $800,000 in personal property qualified for 100% bonus depreciation in 2020 (or would now under OBBBA 2025 provisions), the 481(a) adjustment would be substantial, potentially allowing immediate deduction of most of the $800,000 in the 2025 tax year.

## Question 5
A taxpayer files Form 3115 for a cost segregation change on residential rental property acquired in 2022. Which Designated Change Number (DCN) should they use?

A) DCN 196 (for nonresidential real property)
B) DCN 7 (for residential rental property)
C) DCN 179 (for Section 179 expensing changes)
D) DCN 168 (for general depreciation changes)

**Your Answer**: A
**Correct Answer**: B ✗
**Explanation**: For cost segregation changes involving residential rental property, taxpayers should use Designated Change Number (DCN) 7 on Form 3115. DCN 196 is used for nonresidential real property (commercial buildings such as office buildings, retail stores, warehouses, etc.). The distinction is important because residential rental property (apartments, duplexes, single-family rentals) has a 27.5-year recovery period, while nonresidential real property has a 39-year recovery period. Using the correct DCN ensures the Form 3115 is processed under the proper automatic consent procedures. In this scenario, since the property is specifically identified as "residential rental property," DCN 7 is the appropriate designation. Both DCNs qualify for automatic consent (no user fee, no advance approval), but selecting the correct one is crucial for proper IRS processing and compliance.

## Question 6
When must Form 3115 be filed for an automatic consent accounting method change related to cost segregation?

A) No later than 90 days before the end of the tax year
B) With the taxpayer's timely-filed tax return (including extensions) for the year of change
C) Within 180 days after the end of the tax year
D) On or before the original due date of the return (extensions not allowed)

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: Form 3115 for an automatic consent accounting method change must be filed with the taxpayer's timely-filed tax return (including extensions) for the year of change. This means if the taxpayer wants to make the change effective for 2025, they file Form 3115 with their 2025 tax return, which could be as late as October 15, 2026 if they filed for extensions. The filing consists of two parts: (1) attach the original Form 3115 to the tax return, and (2) send a duplicate copy to the IRS in Ogden, UT no earlier than the first day of the year of change and no later than the date the original is filed with the return. This timing is more flexible than non-automatic changes, which have stricter deadlines and require advance approval. The ability to file with extensions provides taxpayers additional time to complete cost segregation studies and properly prepare the Form 3115.

## Question 7
A taxpayer conducts a look-back cost segregation study and determines that a Section 481(a) adjustment of $500,000 is due (positive adjustment favoring the taxpayer). Under current IRS rules, how is this adjustment typically taken?

A) The entire $500,000 must be spread equally over the remaining recovery period of the assets
B) The entire $500,000 can be taken as a deduction in the current year of change
C) The adjustment must be spread over 10 years at $50,000 per year
D) Only 50% can be taken in the year of change, with the remainder carried forward

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: One of the primary benefits of the Section 481(a) adjustment is that it allows taxpayers to take the entire catch-up depreciation in the current tax year, providing immediate tax benefits. When a positive 481(a) adjustment exists (meaning the new method produces more depreciation than the old method, favoring the taxpayer), the full amount can generally be claimed as a deduction in the year of change. In this scenario, the entire $500,000 would be deductible in the current year along with the regular current-year depreciation on the property. This is far more beneficial than having to amend multiple prior years' returns or spreading the catch-up over future years. Note that for very large positive adjustments (typically over $50,000), taxpayers may have the option to spread the adjustment over 4 years, but this is elective—the default treatment is full deduction in the year of change. This immediate benefit is one of the key reasons cost segregation studies remain valuable even for properties acquired years ago.

## Question 8
A real estate investor is evaluating the optimal timing for filing Form 3115 for a look-back cost segregation study on a property acquired in 2019. Current income is $800,000, but projected income for next year is $2,000,000 due to property sales. The estimated Section 481(a) adjustment is $600,000. Considering strategic tax planning, audit risk, current vs. future tax rates, and the time value of money, what is the most sophisticated analysis of timing considerations?

A) File immediately in the current year to claim the deduction as soon as possible, since earlier deductions are always more valuable due to time value of money
B) Delay filing until next year when income is higher ($2M) to maximize the tax benefit of the $600,000 deduction against higher marginal rates, while considering audit risk, statute of limitations, and whether the current or future tax environment is more favorable
C) Split the study over two years by filing partial Form 3115s to spread the deduction
D) Wait indefinitely until the property is sold to take the adjustment as capital gains treatment

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This is sophisticated tax planning that goes beyond simple "file as soon as possible" thinking. While the time value of money generally favors earlier deductions, that's only one factor in a comprehensive analysis. In this scenario, delaying filing until next year when income jumps from $800,000 to $2,000,000 could provide significantly greater tax savings. At $800,000 income, the investor might be in the 35% federal bracket, making the $600,000 deduction worth approximately $210,000 in tax savings. At $2,000,000 income, they're likely in the 37% bracket, making the same deduction worth $222,000—a $12,000+ difference. Additionally, the strategic analysis must consider: (1) **Audit risk** - IRS scrutiny may vary by year; (2) **Statute of limitations** - the property was acquired in 2019, so 2025/2026 filing is still well within the statute for open years; (3) **Legislative risk** - will current tax rates and depreciation rules remain favorable?; (4) **Cash flow needs** - when is the tax savings most beneficial to the business?; (5) **Other deductions and credits** - how does this interact with the overall tax picture? This multi-factor analysis represents professional-level tax planning that maximizes value for the client beyond simple timing rules.

## Question 9
A taxpayer originally placed a commercial building in service in 2020, depreciating it entirely as 39-year property. They conduct a cost segregation study in 2025, identifying $1.2M in personal property. The study determines that if proper classification had been used from 2020, total depreciation through 2024 would have been $850,000, but only $150,000 was actually claimed (39-year straight-line on the building). Assuming the building was acquired after January 19, 2025 cutoff doesn't apply (pre-OBBBA), and no bonus was available in 2020, calculate the Section 481(a) adjustment and explain how it interacts with the 2025 OBBBA permanent 100% bonus depreciation on the go-forward basis.

A) 481(a) adjustment is $700,000 ($850K - $150K); going forward, the remaining basis receives 39-year treatment since bonus doesn't apply to look-back studies
B) 481(a) adjustment is $850,000 (all missed depreciation); going forward, any remaining basis continues under the original 39-year method
C) 481(a) adjustment is $700,000 ($850K - $150K); going forward, the remaining depreciable basis in the identified personal property continues under MACRS (5, 7, 15-year) without bonus since the property was originally placed in service pre-OBBBA
D) 481(a) adjustment is $700,000; 2025 going-forward depreciation on remaining basis could potentially benefit from OBBBA bonus if the method change is structured properly, though this is complex and property-specific

**Your Answer**: D
**Correct Answer**: C ✗
**Explanation**: The Section 481(a) adjustment is correctly calculated as $700,000—the difference between what should have been claimed ($850,000) and what was actually claimed ($150,000). This catch-up depreciation is taken in 2025. However, the going-forward treatment is determined by when the property was originally placed in service, not when Form 3115 is filed. Since the building was placed in service in 2020 (pre-OBBBA), the identified personal property is treated as having been placed in service in 2020 for all depreciation purposes, including bonus depreciation eligibility. The OBBBA permanent 100% bonus depreciation applies only to property acquired after January 19, 2025. Therefore, going forward from 2025, the remaining depreciable basis in the reclassified personal property continues to depreciate under standard MACRS (5-year, 7-year, 15-year recovery periods) without qualifying for OBBBA's permanent 100% bonus. The assets retain their original 2020 placed-in-service date, and that date controls all depreciation treatment including bonus eligibility. Option D incorrectly suggests that bonus might be available through proper structuring—the placed-in-service date is a factual determination that cannot be manipulated, and it definitively determines bonus eligibility under the acquisition date test.

## Question 10
A tax professional is advising multiple clients on Form 3115 filings for cost segregation studies. Client A has substantial NOLs (Net Operating Losses) that won't expire for 15 years. Client B is a passive real estate investor subject to passive activity loss limitations with limited passive income. Client C is a real estate professional with significant current-year income and active participation. How should the advisor's Form 3115 timing recommendations differ for each client, considering NOL utilization, passive loss limitations, AMT implications, and overall tax strategy?

A) Recommend immediate filing for all three clients since earlier deductions are always more valuable
B) Client A: Delay filing until NOLs are used up or income is higher to maximize value of deductions; Client B: Carefully evaluate since passive losses may be suspended and unusable currently; Client C: File immediately to offset active income in current year
C) Client B should file immediately since passive losses carry forward indefinitely anyway; Clients A and C should delay to future years
D) All three should wait until tax rates potentially increase in future years to maximize the value of deductions

**Your Answer**: B
**Correct Answer**: B ✓
**Explanation**: This represents sophisticated, client-specific tax planning that goes far beyond generic advice. Each client's situation demands a tailored approach:

**Client A (with substantial NOLs)**: Filing Form 3115 immediately would generate a large Section 481(a) deduction, but this deduction would simply create or add to NOLs rather than providing immediate tax savings. Under post-TCJA rules, NOL utilization is limited to 80% of taxable income in future years, potentially delaying full utilization. The advisor should recommend delaying the Form 3115 filing until the NOLs are substantially used up or the client has higher income, allowing the 481(a) adjustment to offset income at full marginal rates rather than being trapped in NOL carryforwards.

**Client B (passive investor with limited passive income)**: Passive activity loss rules under IRC §469 mean that passive losses can generally only offset passive income. If Client B has limited passive income, the Section 481(a) adjustment would generate suspended passive losses that provide no current tax benefit. The advisor must carefully evaluate whether sufficient passive income exists (or is projected) to utilize the deductions, or whether strategies like grouping elections or increasing passive income might be necessary. Filing might be delayed until the client has adequate passive income or disposes of the property (when suspended losses are released).

**Client C (real estate professional with active participation and significant income)**: This is the ideal scenario for immediate filing. Real estate professionals who meet the material participation requirements under IRC §469(c)(7) can deduct rental real estate losses against active income without passive loss limitations. With significant current income, Client C can immediately utilize the Section 481(a) adjustment to reduce taxes at current marginal rates, maximizing the present value of the deduction.

This analysis demonstrates how professional tax advisors must consider each client's unique tax profile, loss limitations, income projections, and overall strategy—rather than applying one-size-fits-all recommendations.
