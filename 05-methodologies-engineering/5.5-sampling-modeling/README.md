# Sampling or Modeling Approach

## Overview

Uses a created model or template to analyze multiple properties that are nearly identical in construction and use. This approach leverages economies of scale by studying a representative sample and applying results to similar properties.

## Typical Users

Common for fast-food chains, retail outlets, and other "prototype" buildings where:
- Multiple locations use standardized designs
- Building specifications are consistent across sites
- Brands maintain uniform construction standards
- Economies of scale justify model development

### Examples
- National restaurant chains with prototype designs
- Retail franchises with standardized store formats
- Hotel chains with consistent room layouts
- Bank branches built to corporate specifications

## Process

### Step 1: Sample Selection
- Identify a representative sample of properties
- Ensure sample captures typical variations
- Document selection criteria
- Verify sample size is statistically appropriate

### Step 2: Detailed Analysis
A detailed study is performed on a small sample of properties using:
- Detailed engineering approach (actual costs or estimates)
- Comprehensive quantity take-offs
- Thorough component analysis
- Proper cost allocation methodology

### Step 3: Model Development
- Calculate percentage allocations from sample analysis
- Document assumptions and standard specifications
- Identify acceptable variation parameters
- Create template for application to remaining properties

### Step 4: Application
Those results (percentages) are applied to the entire population after:
- Verifying similarity to model specifications
- Documenting any significant variations
- Adjusting for location and timing differences
- Reconciling to actual costs for each property

## Risks

Variations in building codes, geographic location, and labor costs can make it difficult to determine a truly accurate model.

### Key Risk Factors
- **Building code variations**: Local requirements may alter construction specifications
- **Geographic differences**: Climate zones affect HVAC, insulation, and other systems
- **Labor cost differentials**: Regional wage rates impact overall cost structure
- **Material availability**: Local material costs and availability vary
- **Site conditions**: Unique site characteristics may require modifications
- **Timing differences**: Construction at different times faces different cost environments

## Quality Controls

To mitigate risks, quality studies include:
- Documentation of acceptable variation thresholds
- Site-specific verification for properties outside normal parameters
- Periodic model updates as specifications change
- Individual review of significant variations
- Statistical validation of model accuracy

## IRS Considerations

The IRS generally accepts this approach when:
- The sample is truly representative
- Detailed analysis of sample properties is thorough
- Variations are documented and justified
- Individual property costs reconcile to actual totals
- The methodology is clearly disclosed

## Advantages

- Cost-effective for multiple similar properties
- Maintains consistency across property portfolio
- Efficient use of resources
- Scalable to large property counts

## Limitations

- Requires truly similar properties
- Must account for variations
- Initial model development requires detailed work
- Model may become outdated as specifications change
