# Detailed Engineering Approach from Actual Cost Records (Invoice Approach)

## Overview

Generally considered the most methodical and accurate approach because it relies on contemporaneous construction and accounting records.

## Data Sources

Uses actual invoices, payment requests, change orders, and "as-built" blueprints to determine the cost of each component. This approach provides the strongest documentation support for cost allocations.

### Primary Documents
- Contractor invoices and payment applications
- Subcontractor payment records
- Change orders and amendments
- As-built drawings and specifications
- Final construction cost reconciliations

## Application

Typically only applied to new construction where detailed cost records are readily available. This method is most practical when:
- The taxpayer was the original owner during construction
- Complete contractor billing records are accessible
- As-built drawings accurately reflect final construction
- Cost records are organized and well-maintained

## Key Step

Reconciling the costs obtained from quantitative "take-offs" to the total actual project costs paid to the contractor. This ensures:
- All costs are accounted for
- No double-counting occurs
- Soft costs are properly allocated
- The total matches actual expenditures

## Advantages

- Highest level of accuracy and defensibility
- Based on actual contemporaneous records
- Minimal estimation required
- Strong audit defense position

## Limitations

- Requires access to detailed construction records
- Time-intensive analysis process
- May not be available for acquired properties
- Dependent on quality of contractor record-keeping
