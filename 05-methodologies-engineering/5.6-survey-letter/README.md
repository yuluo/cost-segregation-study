# Survey or Letter Approach

## Overview

Alternative method involving contacting the actual contractors and subcontractors who performed the work. This approach gathers cost data directly from the parties who installed the assets.

## Process

The analyst asks contractors to provide the specific quantities and prices of the assets they installed.

### Steps
1. **Identify contractors**: Determine all general contractors and subcontractors involved
2. **Prepare inquiries**: Create specific questions about quantities and costs
3. **Gather responses**: Collect detailed information from contractors
4. **Analyze data**: Review responses for completeness and consistency
5. **Reconcile totals**: Ensure sum of responses matches actual project cost

### Example Applications
- Cost of specialized electrical circuits for machinery
- HVAC system components and installation
- Process-specific plumbing installations
- Custom equipment installations
- Specialty construction elements

## Verification

While reasonably reliable if actual data is provided, the data must be checked to ensure it is comparable.

### Verification Requirements
- **Completeness**: All major contractors must respond
- **Accuracy**: Data matches available records
- **Consistency**: Similar items priced consistently
- **Reconciliation**: Total costs must not exceed the actual total project cost
- **Documentation**: Written responses properly archived

## Quality Considerations

### Strengths
- Based on actual contractor knowledge and records
- May reveal details not apparent in general records
- Useful for specialized installations
- Can clarify ambiguous cost allocations

### Weaknesses
- Dependent on contractor cooperation
- May have incomplete responses
- Contractors may lack detailed records
- Time delays in obtaining responses
- Potential for inconsistent reporting

## Best Practices

When using this approach:
- Prepare clear, specific questions
- Provide context and purpose (tax study, not audit)
- Request written responses with supporting documentation
- Follow up on incomplete or unclear responses
- Cross-check responses against available records
- Document all correspondence
- Reconcile to known totals

## IRS Acceptance

The IRS views this method as acceptable when:
- Responses are documented in writing
- Data is verified against other available records
- Total reconciliation is performed
- Methodology is clearly explained in the study
- Responses appear reasonable and consistent

## Practical Application

Often used in combination with other methods:
- Primary method for areas with incomplete records
- Supplemental verification for engineering estimates
- Validation of specific high-value components
- Clarification of specialized installations

## Documentation Requirements

Maintain complete records including:
- Copies of all inquiry letters
- All contractor responses
- Follow-up correspondence
- Reconciliation calculations
- Analysis of variations or discrepancies
