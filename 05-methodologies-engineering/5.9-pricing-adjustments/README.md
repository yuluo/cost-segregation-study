# Estimating: Pricing and Adjustments

## Overview

Once quantities are known, they are multiplied by unit prices to determine the total estimated cost. However, published unit prices must be adjusted to reflect the specific conditions of the project.

## Pricing Adjustments

Blended national prices from manuals must be adjusted for three critical factors:

### 1. Time (Inflation Indexes)

Construction costs change over time due to:
- Material price fluctuations
- Labor wage increases
- Market supply and demand
- Economic conditions

**Adjustment Process**:
- Identify base year of cost data
- Determine project construction date
- Apply appropriate inflation index
- Common indexes: ENR Construction Cost Index, RS Means Historical Cost Indexes

**Example**:
```
Base cost (2020): $50/SF
Project date: 2024
Inflation factor: 1.15
Adjusted cost: $50 × 1.15 = $57.50/SF
```

### 2. Location (Local Market Factors)

Costs vary significantly by geographic location due to:
- Regional labor rates and union requirements
- Local material availability and transportation costs
- Market competition and demand
- Building code requirements
- Climate-specific requirements

**Adjustment Process**:
- Identify location factors from cost manuals
- Apply regional multipliers to base costs
- Consider local market conditions
- Account for rural vs. urban differentials

**Example**:
```
National average cost: $100/SF
San Francisco location factor: 1.35
New York location factor: 1.40
Rural midwest location factor: 0.85
```

### 3. Quality (Cost Rank Selection)

Construction quality affects costs through:
- Material grade and specifications
- Finish levels and detailing
- System sophistication
- Workmanship standards

**Quality Levels** (typical categories):
- **Economy**: Basic materials, minimal detailing
- **Average**: Standard commercial grade
- **Custom**: Higher-grade materials and finishes
- **Luxury**: Premium materials and extensive detailing

**Selection Criteria**:
- Review actual project specifications
- Compare to cost manual descriptions
- Consider market positioning of property
- Evaluate finishes and system quality

## Indirect Costs

Total pricing must also include the allocation of "soft costs" or indirect costs that are not directly tied to physical construction quantities.

### Common Soft Costs

**Professional Fees**:
- Architectural design fees
- Engineering fees (structural, MEP, civil)
- Surveying
- Geotechnical studies
- Special consultants

**Permits and Approvals**:
- Building permits
- Impact fees
- Plan review fees
- Inspection fees
- Special district assessments

**Project Management**:
- Owner's project management
- Construction management fees
- Scheduling and expediting
- Quality control and testing

**Financing and Legal**:
- Construction loan interest
- Legal fees
- Title work
- Insurance during construction

**Other Indirect Costs**:
- Temporary utilities
- Site security
- Marketing and sales (for speculative projects)
- Warranty programs

### Allocation Methods

Soft costs must be allocated to property categories:

**Direct allocation** when possible:
- Engineering fees to specific systems designed
- Permits to eligible property components
- Interest based on construction timeline

**Pro-rata allocation** when direct allocation isn't feasible:
- Distribute based on hard cost percentages
- Apply to all property classes proportionally
- Document allocation methodology

## Pricing Sources

### Published Cost Manuals
- **RS Means**: Comprehensive construction cost data
- **Marshall Valuation Service**: Building valuation and costs
- **Craftsman**: Detailed estimating guides
- **Local cost guides**: Regional specific data

### Requirements for Sources
All pricing sources must include:
- Publication date and edition
- Specific page and line item references
- Base location and time period
- Quality level descriptions

## Reconciliation

Final step ensures accuracy and completeness:

### Total Cost Reconciliation
```
Sum of all component costs
+ Allocated soft costs
+ Contractor markup (if not in unit costs)
= Total estimated/actual project cost
```

### Variance Analysis
- Compare estimated total to known actual cost
- Identify significant discrepancies
- Adjust unit costs or quantities as needed
- Document reconciliation process

### Reasonableness Tests
- Cost per square foot comparisons
- Ratio analysis (MEP as % of total)
- Benchmark against similar projects
- Review outliers for errors

## Documentation Requirements

For each priced item, document:
- Quantity and unit
- Unit price source and reference
- Time adjustment factor applied
- Location adjustment factor applied
- Quality rank selected
- Total extended cost
- Notes on any special conditions

## Common Adjustments

### Contractor Markup
Account for:
- General conditions (typically 5-10%)
- Overhead (typically 5-15%)
- Profit (typically 5-15%)
- Bond and insurance (typically 1-3%)

### Economies of Scale
Adjust for:
- Project size (larger projects may have lower unit costs)
- Repetition (multiple identical units reduce costs)
- Efficiency factors

### Special Conditions
Consider:
- Fast-track scheduling premiums
- Difficult site access
- Phased construction
- Occupied building renovations
- Special safety requirements

## Quality Control

Verify pricing accuracy through:
- Secondary review of calculations
- Comparison to actual invoices when available
- Industry benchmark validation
- Logical relationship tests (e.g., electrical cost should relate to building SF)
