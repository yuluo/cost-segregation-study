# Estimating: Quantification (Take-offs)

## Overview

Quantification is the first step of estimating, where construction components are measured from drawings or field observations. This process forms the foundation for accurate cost allocation in cost segregation studies.

## Procedure

"Taking off" quantities involves using synchronized scales (ruler or electronic) to measure linear distance, area, or volume from blueprints.

### Traditional Methods
- **Scale rulers**: Architect's or engineer's scales matching drawing scale
- **Manual calculation**: Measuring and calculating dimensions
- **Worksheets**: Organized recording of quantities by component

### Modern Methods
- **Digital takeoff software**: On-screen measurement tools (Bluebeam, PlanSwift)
- **BIM models**: Building Information Modeling data extraction
- **Automated tools**: Software that recognizes and counts elements
- **Field measurement**: Laser measuring devices for existing buildings

## Units

Quantities are expressed in units appropriate to each component type:

### Common Units
- **Linear Feet (LF)**: Piping, conduit, trim, fencing, curbing
- **Square Feet (SF)**: Flooring, roofing, walls, ceilings, paving
- **Cubic Yards (CY)**: Concrete, excavation, fill material
- **Each (EA)**: Fixtures, equipment, doors, windows
- **Lump Sum (LS)**: Project elements priced as a whole (mobilization, permits)

### Additional Units
- **Square Yards (SY)**: Carpet, certain finishes
- **Tons (TN)**: Structural steel, HVAC capacity
- **Gallons (GAL)**: Paint, coatings
- **Pounds (LBS)**: Reinforcing steel, specialty items

## Take-off Process

### Step 1: Organize by System
Divide the project into logical systems following CSI MasterFormat divisions:
- Concrete and foundations
- Masonry
- Structural systems
- Exterior enclosure
- Interior construction
- Mechanical systems
- Electrical systems
- Site work

### Step 2: Measure Components
For each system, measure individual components:
- Identify component on drawings
- Determine appropriate unit of measure
- Apply correct scale factor
- Calculate total quantity
- Record on organized worksheet

### Step 3: Document
Record all measurements with:
- Component description
- Drawing reference (sheet number, detail)
- Calculation method
- Quantity and unit
- Notes on assumptions or conditions

## Accuracy Considerations

### Factors Affecting Accuracy
- **Drawing quality**: Completeness and clarity of construction documents
- **Scale accuracy**: Proper calibration of measuring tools
- **As-built conditions**: Differences between plans and actual construction
- **Overlaps and waste**: Material usage beyond net quantities
- **Hidden elements**: Components not visible on drawings

### Best Practices
- Cross-check dimensions from multiple drawing views
- Verify critical dimensions with field observations when possible
- Account for typical waste and overlap factors
- Document assumptions for unclear areas
- Use consistent measurement methods throughout

## Quality Control

Implement checks to ensure accuracy:
- **Secondary review**: Another estimator verifies key quantities
- **Reasonableness test**: Compare to typical ratios (e.g., SF per fixture)
- **Reconciliation**: Ensure component totals align with building totals
- **Benchmark comparison**: Compare to similar completed projects

## Field Verification

For existing buildings or projects with incomplete drawings:
- Conduct physical site visits
- Measure key dimensions directly
- Photograph components for reference
- Note variations from typical construction
- Document inaccessible areas and estimation methods

## Integration with Pricing

Accurate quantification is essential because:
- Quantities directly multiply by unit costs
- Errors compound through the pricing process
- Totals must reconcile to actual project costs
- Documentation must support audit scrutiny

## Common Challenges

### Missing Information
- Incomplete drawings require assumptions
- Document all assumptions clearly
- Use industry standards for typical conditions

### Complex Geometry
- Irregular shapes need careful calculation
- Break complex areas into simpler components
- Use appropriate geometric formulas

### Multiple Levels
- Ensure all floors/levels are counted
- Account for variations between typical floors
- Don't overlook penthouse, basement, or mezzanine areas
