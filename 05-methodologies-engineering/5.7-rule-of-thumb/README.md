# "Rule of Thumb" Approach

## Overview

Based on a preparer's "experience" or industry averages rather than project-specific documentation. This approach applies generalized percentages without detailed analysis of the specific property.

## Example

Estimating that a manufacturing facility is always 40% personal property without performing take-offs or analyzing the actual construction components and specifications.

### Other Common Examples
- "Retail buildings are typically 20-25% personal property"
- "Restaurant improvements average 60% personal property"
- "Warehouse facilities generally have 15% short-lived assets"
- "Office buildings are usually 10-12% personal property"

## IRS Standing

The IRS views this method with extreme caution and generally does not accept it as sufficient support for cost segregation allocations.

### IRS Concerns
- **Lacks sufficient documentation** to support the allocation
- Does not account for property-specific characteristics
- No verification of actual construction components
- Impossible to reconcile to actual project costs
- Cannot be independently verified or reproduced

## Why This Approach Fails

### Fundamental Problems
1. **Over-generalization**: No two properties are truly identical
2. **Ignores specifics**: Fails to analyze actual construction
3. **No support**: Lacks documentation for audit defense
4. **Varies widely**: "Industry averages" can differ dramatically
5. **Professional standards**: Violates appraisal and engineering standards

### Property Variations
Even similar property types vary significantly based on:
- Age and vintage of construction
- Geographic location and building codes
- Tenant improvements and customization
- Quality of construction materials
- Intended use and operational requirements
- Technological systems installed

## Audit Risk

Cost segregation studies relying on rule of thumb approaches face:
- High likelihood of IRS challenge
- Difficulty defending allocations
- Potential disallowance of entire study
- Professional credibility concerns
- Possible penalties for lack of reasonable basis

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of rule of thumb, use:
- **Detailed engineering**: Actual analysis of property components
- **Cost estimating**: Recognized cost data sources
- **Sampling**: Detailed study of representative areas
- **Survey**: Direct contractor data gathering

## Limited Acceptable Use

Rule of thumb may only be marginally acceptable for:
- Initial screening to determine if full study is warranted
- Very preliminary budget estimates
- Internal planning purposes (not tax reporting)
- Quick comparisons during property evaluation

Even in these cases, the limitations must be clearly disclosed.

## Professional Standards

Professional organizations discourage this approach:
- Engineering standards require project-specific analysis
- Appraisal standards mandate actual property inspection
- Tax preparation standards require reasonable basis
- Quality assurance protocols demand documentation

## Conclusion

While "rule of thumb" may seem efficient and cost-effective, it fails to meet IRS requirements and professional standards for cost segregation studies. Quality studies must analyze the specific property using recognized methodologies with proper documentation and support.
