# Methodologies and Engineering Approaches

## IRS-Recognized Cost Estimation Methods

The IRS Audit Techniques Guide identifies six acceptable approaches for estimating costs in cost segregation studies.

### 1. Detailed Engineering Approach
- Most precise and defendable method
- Bottom-up build-up of component costs
- Uses actual construction specifications
- Requires detailed blueprints and plans
- Applies unit costs to measured quantities

**Best for**: New construction, major renovations with complete documentation

### 2. Sampling/Statistical Approach
- Analyzes representative sample of components
- Extrapolates results to entire property
- Requires statistically valid sampling methodology
- Documents sample selection criteria

**Best for**: Large, repetitive properties (hotels, apartment complexes)

### 3. Survey/Interview Approach
- Gathers cost data from project participants
- Interviews contractors, architects, engineers
- Validates with purchase orders and invoices
- Documents all sources

**Best for**: Recent construction with accessible parties

### 4. Contractor's Records Approach
- Uses actual contractor invoices and records
- Breaks down costs by trade and component
- Requires detailed cost accounting by contractor
- Most accurate historical cost data

**Best for**: Properties with comprehensive contractor documentation

### 5. Residual Estimation Approach
- Starts with total known cost
- Segregates identifiable components
- Allocates remaining costs proportionally
- Uses engineering judgment for allocation

**Best for**: Properties with limited documentation

### 6. Rule of Thumb Approach (Limited Use)
- Applies industry percentages or ratios
- Least precise method
- Only acceptable with no better information available
- Requires strong supporting rationale

**Best for**: Small components or when other methods impractical

## Estimating Procedures

### Cost Trending
- Adjusts historical costs to placed-in-service date
- Uses appropriate cost indices (Marshall & Swift, RS Means)
- Accounts for location factors
- Documents trending methodology

### Allocation Methods
- Direct assignment when possible
- Proportional allocation when necessary
- Engineering judgment for hybrid systems
- Consistent application of principles

### Quality Control
- Independent review of estimates
- Reconciliation to total costs
- Reasonableness testing
- Documentation of assumptions

## CSI MasterFormat System

### Overview
Construction Specifications Institute's standardized classification system for construction information.

### Division Structure
Organized into divisions representing construction trades:
- **Division 01**: General Requirements
- **Division 02**: Existing Conditions
- **Division 03**: Concrete
- **Division 04**: Masonry
- **Division 05**: Metals
- **Division 06**: Wood, Plastics, Composites
- **Division 07**: Thermal and Moisture Protection
- **Division 08**: Openings (doors, windows)
- **Division 09**: Finishes
- **Division 10**: Specialties
- **Division 11**: Equipment
- **Division 12**: Furnishings
- **Division 13**: Special Construction
- **Division 14**: Conveying Equipment
- **Divisions 21-28**: Facility Services (MEP)
- **Division 31**: Earthwork
- **Division 32**: Exterior Improvements

### Application to Cost Segregation
- Organizes cost data systematically
- Facilitates asset classification
- Provides consistent framework
- Enables detailed analysis by trade

### Cross-Referencing
- Maps MasterFormat to tax asset classes
- Links construction components to recovery periods
- Documents classification rationale
- Supports audit defense

## Engineering Analysis Components

### Site Inspection
- Physical observation of property
- Photography and documentation
- Measurements and verification
- Interviews with property personnel

### Blueprint Review
- Architectural drawings analysis
- Engineering specifications review
- Identification of systems and components
- Verification against as-built conditions

### Cost Build-Up
- Quantity take-offs from plans
- Unit cost application
- Labor and material breakdown
- Contractor markup inclusion

### Classification
- Application of tax law to components
- Assignment to recovery periods
- Documentation of rationale
- Support for positions taken
