# Detailed Engineering Cost Estimate Approach (Engineering Approach)

## Overview

Similar to the invoice approach but uses estimated costs rather than actual costs. This method applies engineering principles and industry-standard costing data to allocate purchase price or project costs.

## Usage

### Primary Applications

**For acquisitions of existing property where the purchase price must be allocated**
- Original construction records unavailable
- Property acquired from third party
- Multiple owners since original construction

**For new projects where original construction documents are missing**
- Incomplete or lost contractor records
- Simplified contractor billing
- Owner-performed construction with limited documentation

## Costing Data

Estimates are derived from contractors or reliable published sources such as:
- **R.S. Means Cost Data**: Industry-standard construction cost reference
- **Marshall Valuation Service**: Comprehensive valuation and cost data
- **Other recognized sources**: Regional cost guides, specialty estimating manuals

### Data Requirements
All costing sources must be:
- Published and recognized in the construction industry
- Current for the relevant time period (adjusted for inflation)
- Appropriate for the property type and location
- Properly cited and documented

## Reliability

The report must clearly reference the specific volume, page, and item number of the estimating data used. This ensures:
- Transparency in cost allocation methodology
- Reproducibility of results
- Verification by third parties (IRS, reviewers)
- Professional credibility

## Quality Standards

A quality engineering cost estimate approach includes:
- Detailed quantity take-offs from available drawings or field measurements
- Appropriate selection of cost data matching property characteristics
- Proper adjustments for time, location, and quality factors
- Reconciliation of total estimated costs to actual acquisition or project costs
- Clear documentation of all assumptions and sources

## Advantages

- Applicable when actual cost records are unavailable
- Uses standardized, recognized cost data
- Reproducible and verifiable methodology
- Widely accepted by IRS when properly documented

## Limitations

- Less accurate than actual cost records
- Requires professional judgment in cost selection
- Subject to estimation errors
- Must be properly adjusted for market conditions
