# CSI MasterFormat

## Overview

The Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) provides a standardized system for organizing building project data. MasterFormat is the most widely used standard for organizing specifications and other written information for commercial and institutional building projects in the U.S. and Canada.

## Divisions

Information is organized into numbered divisions that categorize construction work by discipline and type.

### Pre-2004 Structure
16 divisions were used:
- Division 1: General Requirements
- Division 2: Site Construction
- Division 3: Concrete
- Division 4: Masonry
- Division 5: Metals
- Division 6: Wood and Plastics
- Division 7: Thermal and Moisture Protection
- Division 8: Doors and Windows
- Division 9: Finishes
- Division 10: Specialties
- Division 11: Equipment
- Division 12: Furnishings
- Division 13: Special Construction
- Division 14: Conveying Systems
- Division 15: Mechanical
- Division 16: Electrical

### Post-2004 Structure (Current)
50 divisions provide more detailed organization:

**Procurement and Contracting Requirements Group**
- Division 00: Procurement and Contracting Requirements

**General Requirements Group**
- Division 01: General Requirements

**Facility Construction Subgroup**
- Division 02: Existing Conditions
- Division 03: Concrete
- Division 04: Masonry
- Division 05: Metals
- Division 06: Wood, Plastics, and Composites
- Division 07: Thermal and Moisture Protection
- Division 08: Openings
- Division 09: Finishes
- Division 10: Specialties
- Division 11: Equipment
- Division 12: Furnishings
- Division 13: Special Construction
- Division 14: Conveying Equipment
- Division 19: Reserved

**Facility Services Subgroup**
- Division 20: Reserved
- Division 21: Fire Suppression
- Division 22: Plumbing
- Division 23: Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
- Division 25: Integrated Automation
- Division 26: Electrical
- Division 27: Communications
- Division 28: Electronic Safety and Security
- Division 29: Reserved

**Site and Infrastructure Subgroup**
- Division 30: Reserved
- Division 31: Earthwork
- Division 32: Exterior Improvements
- Division 33: Utilities
- Division 34: Transportation
- Division 35: Waterway and Marine Construction
- Division 40: Process Integration
- Division 41-49: Reserved

## Standard Practice

Analysts should follow the same CSI divisions used by the contractor to ensure consistency.

### Benefits of Consistency
- Easier reconciliation with contractor invoices
- Clear correlation between estimates and actual costs
- Standardized communication with all parties
- Simplified audit trail
- Industry-wide understanding

### Application in Cost Segregation

Using CSI divisions helps organize:
- Quantity take-offs by system
- Cost estimates by trade
- Asset classification by component
- Documentation and reporting
- Reconciliation to contractor billings

## Common Divisions in Cost Segregation

### Division 03 (Concrete)
Critical for determining:
- Structural vs. non-structural concrete
- Building foundation vs. land improvements
- Specialized concrete for manufacturing
- Concrete removability analysis

**Key Components**:
- Footings and foundations
- Structural slabs and columns
- Walls (load-bearing vs. partition)
- Specialized process slabs

### Division 15/22-23 (Mechanical Systems)
Important for identifying:
- Building HVAC (39-year)
- Process cooling/heating (5-7 year)
- General plumbing vs. process-specific

**Old Division 15 split into**:
- Division 22: Plumbing
- Division 23: HVAC

**Key Components**:
- Piping systems
- HVAC equipment and distribution
- Controls and automation
- Specialized process systems

### Division 16/26-28 (Electrical Systems)
Critical for segregating:
- General building power (39-year)
- Dedicated machinery circuits (5-7 year)
- Lighting systems
- Fire alarm and security

**Old Division 16 split into**:
- Division 26: Electrical
- Division 27: Communications
- Division 28: Electronic Safety and Security

**Key Components**:
- Service and distribution
- Branch wiring and devices
- Lighting fixtures
- Specialty systems

## Hierarchical Structure

MasterFormat uses a hierarchical numbering system:

### Level 1: Division
```
Division 09 - Finishes
```

### Level 2: Section
```
09 50 00 - Ceilings
```

### Level 3: Subsection
```
09 51 00 - Acoustical Ceilings
```

### Level 4: Detail
```
09 51 13 - Acoustical Panel Ceilings
```

This allows increasingly specific organization of project data.

## Using MasterFormat in Studies

### Organization
- Structure take-offs by division
- Group costs by major system
- Maintain contractor organization for reconciliation

### Documentation
- Reference CSI division in component descriptions
- Cross-reference to contractor line items
- Maintain consistent terminology

### Communication
- Industry professionals understand CSI divisions
- Facilitates review by engineers and contractors
- Supports clear audit documentation

## Transition Considerations

When working with older projects:
- Identify which MasterFormat edition was used
- Maintain original division structure for reconciliation
- Document any conversion to current divisions
- Note differences in classification

## Integration with Cost Data

Major cost estimating sources organize by MasterFormat:
- RS Means follows MasterFormat divisions
- Contractor billing often uses CSI structure
- Specification manuals reference divisions
- Industry benchmarks reported by division

## Best Practices

For cost segregation studies:
- Use the MasterFormat edition that matches available documentation
- Maintain consistency throughout the study
- Cross-reference between old and new divisions when necessary
- Document the organizational structure used
- Ensure all team members understand the division system applied
