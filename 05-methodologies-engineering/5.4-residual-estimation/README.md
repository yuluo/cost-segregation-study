# Residual Estimation Approach

## Overview

An abbreviated method that focuses only on identifying the costs of short-lived assets (e.g., 5 or 7-year personal property). This approach uses a simplified calculation to allocate costs between personal property and real property.

## Process

### Step 1: Identify Short-Lived Assets
- Enumerate all 5-year and 7-year property components
- Estimate or calculate costs for these specific items
- Total all short-lived asset costs

### Step 2: Calculate Residual
- Short-lived asset costs are totaled and then subtracted from the total project cost
- The "residual" amount is assigned to the building and other long-lived assets

### Formula
```
Real Property (39-year) = Total Project Cost - Personal Property (5-year + 7-year)
```

## Weakness

Less accurate than engineering approaches because residual costs are generally not checked for reasonableness or reconciled to the actual total project cost.

### Specific Issues
- **No validation**: The residual amount is accepted without verification
- **Compounding errors**: Errors in personal property estimation directly affect real property allocation
- **Lack of detail**: Building components are not individually analyzed
- **Limited support**: Weak documentation for the residual allocation

## When Used

This method may be considered when:
- Budget constraints limit detailed analysis
- Personal property components are easily identifiable and quantifiable
- Real property components are relatively homogeneous
- Quick estimates are needed for planning purposes

## IRS Perspective

The IRS generally prefers more detailed methodologies but may accept the residual approach when:
- Personal property costs are well-documented
- The residual amount appears reasonable for the property type
- Total costs reconcile to actual expenditures
- The approach is clearly disclosed and explained

## Best Practices

If using this method:
- Thoroughly document all personal property cost estimates
- Perform reasonableness checks on the residual amount
- Consider comparative analysis with similar properties
- Clearly disclose the methodology and its limitations
- Be prepared to defend the approach in audit situations

## Comparison to Detailed Methods

| Aspect | Residual Approach | Detailed Engineering |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Accuracy | Lower | Higher |
| Documentation | Minimal | Comprehensive |
| Cost/Time | Lower | Higher |
| IRS Acceptance | Conditional | Strong |
| Audit Defense | Weaker | Stronger |
