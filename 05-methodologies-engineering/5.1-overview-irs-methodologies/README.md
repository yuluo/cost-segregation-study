# Overview of IRS-Recognized Methodologies

## Introduction

The IRS identifies and recognizes six primary cost segregation methodologies. While the IRS does not recommend any one specific approach, quality studies often use elements from multiple methods depending on the availability of records.

## The Six Methods

1. **Detailed Engineering Approach from Actual Cost Records**
2. **Detailed Engineering Cost Estimate Approach**
3. **Survey or Letter Approach**
4. **Residual Estimation Approach**
5. **Sampling or Modeling Approach**
6. **"Rule of Thumb" Approach**

## Key Considerations

The choice of methodology depends on several factors:
- Availability of contemporaneous construction records
- Type of property acquisition (new construction vs. existing property)
- Quality and detail requirements for the study
- IRS scrutiny and audit defense considerations

## Best Practices

Quality cost segregation studies typically:
- Combine elements from multiple methodologies where appropriate
- Use the most detailed approach that available documentation supports
- Ensure all cost allocations reconcile to actual total project costs
- Provide clear documentation and support for all estimates and assumptions
