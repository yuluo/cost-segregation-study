# Certification of the Preparer

## Introduction

The certification of the preparer is a formal statement signed by the lead professional that establishes professional credibility and personal accountability for the study's findings and methodology. This certification is required by the American Society of Cost Segregation Professionals (ASCSP) Minimum Quality Standards and serves as critical documentation for audit defense, demonstrating that a qualified professional has taken personal responsibility for the work performed.

The certification transforms an impersonal report into a professional representation backed by individual credentials and reputation. It assures the client, their CPA, and the IRS that the study was prepared by a qualified professional applying appropriate standards and methodologies, and that the conclusions are supported by reasonable professional judgment based on actual site inspection and analysis.

## Preparer Certification Requirements

A complete preparer certification must include specific elements that demonstrate compliance with professional standards and establish the preparer's personal involvement and accountability.

**Required Statement Elements**

**Professional Standards Compliance**

The certification must affirmatively state that the study complies with applicable professional standards:

*ASCSP Minimum Quality Standards:*
"This cost segregation study has been prepared in accordance with the Minimum Quality Standards established by the American Society of Cost Segregation Professionals."

*Professional Engineering Standards:*
"The engineering analysis and methodology employed in this study comply with applicable professional engineering standards and practices."

*Tax Law and Regulations:*
"The tax and legal analysis applies current Internal Revenue Code provisions, Treasury Regulations, and relevant judicial precedents."

**Appropriate Methodology**

The certification must affirm that the methodology used is appropriate for the subject property:

*Methodology Appropriate for Property Type:*
"The methodology employed is appropriate for the property type, available documentation, and scope of engagement."

*IRS-Recognized Approach:*
"The study employs an IRS-recognized methodology as described in the IRS Audit Techniques Guide for Cost Segregation."

*Detailed Engineering or Other Approved Method:*
"A detailed engineering approach [or specify other method] has been applied, utilizing [quantity take-offs, actual costs, cost estimates, etc.]."

**Reasonable Assumptions**

Professional judgment acknowledgment:

*Conclusions Based on Reasonable Assumptions:*
"The conclusions presented in this study are based on reasonable professional assumptions given the available data and information."

*Estimates Supported by Available Data:*
"Where estimates were necessary due to incomplete data, such estimates are supported by engineering analysis, cost databases, and industry standards."

*Conservative Approach:*
"Where professional judgment was required, a reasonable and conservative approach was applied to ensure supportable and defensible positions."

**Personal Knowledge**

Critical affirmation of personal involvement:

*Site Inspection Personally Conducted or Supervised:*
"I [or my designated representative under my supervision] personally conducted a physical inspection of the subject property on [date]."

*Property Physically Observed:*
"The property was physically observed, including exterior, interior, building systems, and site improvements to the extent accessible."

*Client Information Reviewed and Verified:*
"Cost data, architectural and engineering drawings, and other information provided by the client have been reviewed and verified to the extent practicable."

**Independence Statement** (if applicable)

For studies where independence enhances credibility:

*No Financial Interest in Property:*
"I have no present or contemplated financial interest in the subject property."

*No Conflict of Interest:*
"I have no conflict of interest or bias concerning the property or the parties involved."

*Objective Analysis Performed:*
"The analysis has been performed objectively and impartially."

*Compensation Not Contingent:*
"My compensation for this engagement is not contingent upon the tax benefit derived from the study or the specific findings and conclusions."

This independence statement is particularly important for studies that may be challenged or for clients who desire the highest level of objectivity.

The certification of the preparer serves as the personal professional representation that gives the cost segregation study its credibility and authority. A strong, complete certification by a well-qualified professional provides assurance to the client, their tax advisors, and the IRS that the study has been prepared competently, objectively, and in accordance with the highest professional standards. This personal accountability distinguishes quality professional work from impersonal, potentially unreliable analysis.
