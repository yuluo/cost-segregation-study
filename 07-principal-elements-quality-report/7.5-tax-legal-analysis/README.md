# Tax and Legal Analysis

## Introduction

A quality cost segregation study does not simply reallocate costs from one depreciation category to another; it provides comprehensive legal and tax analysis justifying why specific components qualify for accelerated depreciation treatment. This legal analysis demonstrates technical competence in tax law, supports classification positions with statutory and case law authority, serves as critical documentation for audit defense, and distinguishes a professional quality study from a superficial analysis.

The tax and legal analysis section transforms engineering findings into legally defensible tax positions, applying relevant Internal Revenue Code sections, Treasury Regulations, and judicial precedents to the specific facts of the subject property. This section demonstrates that classifications are not arbitrary but are grounded in established legal principles.

## Applicable IRC Sections

**§168 - Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)**

Section 168 establishes the framework for depreciating tangible property placed in service after 1986:

**MACRS Depreciation Framework:**
- General Depreciation System (GDS) vs. Alternative Depreciation System (ADS)
- Applicable depreciation method by property class
- Recovery period determination
- Placed-in-service date requirements

**Recovery Periods for Different Asset Classes:**
- 3-year property (certain specialized items)
- 5-year property (automobiles, computers, qualified technology equipment)
- 7-year property (office furniture, most machinery and equipment)
- 15-year property (land improvements, qualified leasehold improvements)
- 27.5-year property (residential rental property)
- 39-year property (nonresidential real property)

**Depreciation Methods:**
- 200% declining balance for 5-year and 7-year property
- 150% declining balance for 15-year property
- Straight-line for 27.5-year and 39-year property
- Alternative straight-line election available

**Conventions:**
- Half-year convention (typical)
- Mid-quarter convention (when >40% of basis placed in service in Q4)
- Mid-month convention (for real property)

**§1245 - Personal Property**

Section 1245 defines personal property and certain other tangible property:

**Definition and Scope:**

## Court Case Application

Court cases provide crucial precedent for asset classification. The tax and legal analysis must apply relevant case law to the specific facts of the subject property.

**Hospital Corporation of America v. Commissioner (109 T.C. 21, 1997)**

This landmark Tax Court case established key principles for cost segregation:

**Key Holdings:**
- Specialized systems serving equipment are personal property
- Dedicated electrical systems for medical equipment are §1245 property
- HVAC systems serving specialized equipment, not general building comfort, are personal property

**Application to Subject Property:**
- Analysis of HVAC systems: general comfort vs. equipment-specific
- Evaluation of electrical systems: dedicated equipment circuits vs. general building power
- Specialized systems identified and classified as personal property
- Precedent supporting allocation of MEP systems

**Example Application:**
"Following the precedent established in Hospital Corporation of America, the dedicated HVAC system serving the server room equipment, which operates 24/7 at 65°F regardless of building occupancy and is sized solely for equipment heat load, is properly classified as §1245 personal property with a 5-year recovery period. This system is independent of the building's general comfort HVAC and its sole justification is to serve the business equipment."

**Whiteco Industries v. Commissioner (65 T.C. 664, 1975)**

Whiteco established the six permanency tests for determining whether property is real or personal:

**Six Permanency Tests:**
1. Is the property capable of being moved, and has it in fact been moved?
2. Is the property designed or constructed to remain permanently in place?
3. Are there circumstances which tend to show the expected or intended length of affixation?
4. How substantial is the property?
5. How much damage would be caused by the property's removal?
6. How is the property attached to the realty?

**Application to Removable Components:**
- Decorative millwork and built-in cabinetry analysis
- Specialized flooring (removable carpet, raised floors)
- Equipment installations
- Movable partition systems

**Example Application:**
"The custom reception desk, while substantial in size, is constructed of modular components bolted together and to the floor with removable fasteners. Applying the Whiteco tests: (1) it is capable of being moved and could be relocated; (2) not designed to remain permanently—constructed for relocation if needed; (3) intended for the current tenant's use, not permanent building feature; (4) substantial but modular; (5) removal would cause minimal damage—fill bolt holes; (6) attached with removable fasteners, not welded or embedded. Conclusion: §1245 personal property, 7-year recovery."

**Piggly Wiggly Southern, Inc. v. Commissioner**

This case addressed refrigeration systems in retail stores:

**Key Holdings:**
- Refrigeration systems in grocery stores are personal property
- Systems serve business operations, not building
- Walk-in coolers and freezers are personal property
- Display case refrigeration is personal property

**"Sole Justification" Test:**
- Is the sole justification for the system the business operations?
- If system wouldn't exist but for business needs, likely personal property
- Applied to HVAC, refrigeration, specialized systems

**Application to Retail/Restaurant Properties:**
- Kitchen refrigeration systems
- Display coolers and freezers
- Specialized cooling systems
- Walk-in coolers and freezers

**Example Application:**
"The walk-in freezer unit, including insulated panels, refrigeration equipment, and racking, serves solely for food storage for the restaurant operations. Following Piggly Wiggly, this specialized refrigeration system's sole justification is business operations, not building occupancy. The system is properly classified as §1245 personal property with 5-year recovery."

**Scott Paper Co. v. Commissioner (T.C. Memo 1980-239)**

Scott Paper addressed allocation of electrical systems based on load analysis:

**Key Holdings:**
- Electrical system can be allocated between building and equipment use
- Load study or engineering analysis supports allocation
- Portion serving equipment is personal property
- Reasonable allocation methodology accepted

**Electrical Load Allocation:**
- Calculate total electrical capacity
- Identify equipment-dedicated circuits and capacity
- Allocate based on capacity serving equipment vs. building
- Apply percentage to electrical system costs

**Application to Subject Property's Electrical Systems:**
- Load analysis performed
- Equipment loads identified and quantified
- Percentage of system serving equipment calculated
- Allocation applied to electrical system costs

**Example Application:**
"A load study analysis, following the methodology accepted in Scott Paper, determined that 35% of the electrical service capacity is dedicated to production equipment loads. The main service equipment, panelboards, and distribution systems are allocated 35% to §1245 personal property (5-year) and 65% to §1250 real property (39-year), based on this engineering analysis of connected loads and dedicated circuits."

**Boddie-Noell Enterprises v. Commissioner (T.C. Memo 1996-336)**

This case established the "look and feel" concept for restaurant décor:

**Key Holdings:**
- Decorative elements contributing to restaurant's theme and "look and feel" are personal property
- Custom millwork, decorative lighting, themed finishes
- These elements serve business purpose, not building structure
- Removable and replaced when theme changes

**"Look and Feel" Concept:**
- Decorative and thematic elements
- Business-specific design features
- Marketing and branding elements
- Temporary or theme-oriented finishes

**Application to Interior Finishes:**
- Custom decorative millwork
- Themed lighting fixtures
- Specialty wall and ceiling finishes
- Branding elements integrated into architecture

**Example Application:**
"The custom wood paneling, decorative beam wraps, and themed light fixtures in the dining areas create the restaurant's distinctive Western ranch theme and contribute to its 'look and feel' as established in Boddie-Noell. These decorative elements serve the business brand and marketing, not the building structure, and would be removed or replaced with any concept change. Classification: §1245 personal property, 7-year recovery."

## Classification Principles Applied

**Sole Justification Test**

The sole justification test asks: Is the sole justification for this component the business operations rather than the building occupancy?

**Applied to HVAC Systems:**
- General comfort HVAC: serves building occupants = §1250 (39-year)
- Equipment cooling HVAC: serves specialized equipment = §1245 (5-year)
- Process HVAC: serves manufacturing process = §1245 (5 or 7-year)
- Analysis of system purpose and capacity

**Applied to Electrical Systems:**
- General lighting and convenience outlets = §1250 (39-year)
- Dedicated equipment circuits = §1245 (5-year)
- Process electrical systems = §1245 (5 or 7-year)
- Load analysis and allocation methodology

**Business Necessity vs. Building Necessity:**
- Would the system exist if building were used for general purposes?
- Is the system sized for business operations beyond building requirements?
- Does the system operate on different schedule or parameters than building needs?

**Documentation of Business-Specific Requirements:**
- Engineering analysis of system capacity
- Comparison to code-minimum or typical building systems
- Operational characteristics supporting business use

**Functional Interdependence Test**

Applied under the Tangible Property Regulations to determine unit of property:

**Unit of Property Determinations:**
- Are components placed in service together?
- Do they function interdependently?
- Can one component function without the other?

**System Dependencies:**
- HVAC components functioning as integrated system
- Electrical distribution from service to end use
- Plumbing supply and drainage systems

**Component Groupings:**
- Related components grouped as single unit
- Evaluation of which components must be grouped
- Impact on classification and partial disposition

**Impact on Classifications:**
- How grouping affects recovery period assignment
- Whether entire unit or individual components classified separately
- Coordination with depreciation rules

**Whiteco Permanency Tests**

The six tests applied systematically to borderline items:

**Applied to Removable Fixtures:**
- Movable partitions
- Modular furniture systems
- Removable equipment installations

**Applied to Equipment Installations:**
- Machinery bolted to floors
- Equipment with utility connections
- Skid-mounted or mobile equipment

**Mobility Analysis:**
- Can component be moved?
- Has it been or could it be relocated?
- Portability considerations

**Affixation Analysis:**
- How is component attached?
- Permanent affixation or temporary fastening?
- Damage caused by removal?
- Ease of disconnection and removal?

**Inherently Permanent Structural Component Analysis**

Distinguishing structural building components from personal property:

**Building Structure Identification:**
- Load-bearing walls and columns
- Foundation and structural floor slabs
- Roof structure (trusses, decking)
- Building shell and envelope

**Structural Component Determination:**
- Components related to building operation or maintenance
- Integral to building functioning as shelter
- Not removable without damaging building integrity

**Distinction from Personal Property:**
- Personal property serves business, not building
- Personal property removable and replaceable
- Personal property not integral to building structure

**Load-Bearing vs. Non-Load-Bearing:**
- Load-bearing = structural = §1250 (39-year)
- Non-load-bearing interior partitions = potentially §1245
- Non-load-bearing decorative elements = potentially §1245

## System-by-System Legal Analysis

**HVAC Systems**

**General Comfort HVAC:**

*Characteristics:*
- Serves building occupants for comfort
- Standard capacity for occupancy type
- Operates during occupied hours
- Temperature setpoints for human comfort (68-75°F typical)

*Classification:* §1250 Real Property (39-year)

*Supporting Analysis:*
"The rooftop HVAC units serving the office areas provide general comfort cooling and heating for building occupants. The capacity (approximately 1 ton per 300-400 SF) is typical for commercial office occupancy. The systems operate during business hours on a standard temperature schedule for human comfort. These systems are inherently permanent components of the building, serving the building generally, and are properly classified as §1250 property with a 39-year recovery period under §168(e)(2)(B)."

**Process-Specific HVAC:**

*Characteristics:*
- Serves specialized equipment, not human occupants
- Capacity exceeds building comfort requirements
- Operates 24/7 or on specialized schedule
- Temperature/humidity requirements for equipment or process

*Sole Justification Test Application:*
- System wouldn't exist but for business equipment or process
- Capacity driven by equipment heat load or process requirements
- Independent of general building HVAC

*Classification:* §1245 Personal Property (5 or 7-year)

*Supporting Case Law:*
- Hospital Corporation of America (equipment-specific HVAC)
- Piggly Wiggly (refrigeration systems)

*Example Analysis:*
"The dedicated computer room air conditioning (CRAC) unit serving the server room operates 24/7 maintaining 65°F ±2° and 50% RH ±5%, regardless of building occupancy. The unit is sized solely for server equipment heat load (approximately 45,000 BTU/hr), not human occupancy. Following Hospital Corporation of America, the sole justification for this system is to serve business equipment, not building occupancy. Classification: §1245 personal property, 5-year recovery period."

**Electrical Systems**

**General Building Electrical:**

*Components:*
- General lighting systems
- Convenience outlets and receptacles
- Standard building power distribution
- Exit lighting and emergency lighting

*Classification:* §1250 Real Property (39-year)

*Analysis:*
"The general lighting and power systems serving the building for standard occupancy are structural components under §1.48-1(e)(2). These systems provide power for lights, convenience receptacles, and general building operations. They are integral to the building's function and operation."

**Specialized Equipment Circuits:**

*Components:*
- Dedicated machinery circuits
- High-voltage equipment feeds (208V, 480V)
- Special equipment disconnects and starters
- Equipment-specific power distribution

*Load Analysis Performed:*

- Equipment loads calculated and documented
- Percentage allocated to equipment vs. building

*Classification:* §1245 Personal Property (5-year)

*Scott Paper Precedent Applied:*
"Following the methodology accepted in Scott Paper, an electrical load analysis was performed. The manufacturing equipment requires dedicated 480V, 3-phase power totaling 750 kVA. The total building electrical service is 2,000 kVA. Based on engineering analysis, 38% of the electrical distribution system (service equipment, transformers, panels, feeders, and branch circuits) is allocated to equipment use and classified as §1245 property with 5-year recovery. The remaining 62% serves general building use and is classified as §1250 property, 39-year recovery."

**Allocation Methodology:**

Engineering analysis determines:
1. Total electrical capacity (kVA or amps)
2. Equipment-dedicated loads (from equipment nameplates and drawings)
3. General building loads (lighting, receptacles, HVAC, etc.)
4. Allocation percentage = Equipment loads ÷ Total capacity
5. Apply percentage to electrical system costs

## Plumbing Systems

**Standard Plumbing:**

*Components:*
- Restroom fixtures and piping
- Domestic water distribution
- Sanitary drainage and vents
- Water heaters for general use

*Classification:* §1250 Real Property (39-year)

*Analysis:*
"The plumbing systems serving restrooms, break rooms, and general building uses are inherently permanent structural components. These systems are integral to the building's operation and are properly classified as §1250 property under §1.48-1(e)(2), with 39-year recovery."

**Process Plumbing:**

*Components:*
- Manufacturing process water systems
- Specialized drainage (acid waste, industrial drains)
- Process cooling water or steam systems
- Equipment-specific plumbing

*Characteristics:*
- Serves business operations, not building occupancy
- Specialized materials or sizing
- Direct connection to manufacturing or process equipment

*Classification:* §1245 Personal Property (5 or 7-year)

*Supporting Rationale:*
"The process cooling water system, including chilled water piping, pumps, cooling tower, and connections to manufacturing equipment, serves solely the production equipment cooling requirements. This system is independent of building operations and its sole justification is business equipment. Following the principles established in Hospital Corporation of America and Piggly Wiggly, this system is properly classified as §1245 property. Recovery period: 5-year as property used in connection with manufacturing."

## Special Systems Analysis

**Refrigeration Systems:**

*Application of Piggly Wiggly:*
- Walk-in coolers and freezers = §1245 personal property

- Lease terms govern ownership determination
- Tenant improvements by tenant = tenant depreciates
- Landlord-owned improvements = landlord depreciates

*Recovery Period Determination:*
- Qualified Improvement Property (post-2017): 15-year
- Non-QIP improvements: 39-year
- Personal property and land improvements: per asset class

**Qualified Improvement Property (QIP)**

*Definition and Requirements (post-TCJA):*
- Improvement to interior portion of nonresidential building
- Placed in service after building was placed in service
- Not for enlargement, elevator/escalator, or internal structural framework

*Interaction with Cost Segregation:*
- QIP eligible for bonus depreciation (after Technical Corrections)
- 15-year recovery period (after Technical Corrections intended)
- Cost segregation within QIP to identify personal property
- Personal property shorter recovery period than QIP

*Bonus Depreciation Eligibility:*
- QIP qualifies for bonus depreciation
- Personal property within QIP also qualifies
- Enhanced benefits for qualified property

*Proper Classification:*
- Structural components of QIP: 39-year (until corrected)
- Personal property within QIP: 5-year or 7-year
- Land improvements: 15-year

**Tenant vs. Landlord Issues**

*Ownership Determination:*
- Review lease provisions
- Identify who paid for improvements
- Determine legal ownership
- Assignment of depreciation

*Tax Treatment Differences:*
- Owner depreciates over property life
- Tenant may have different recovery (lease term in some cases)
- Removal obligations affect analysis

*Lease Terms Impact:*
- Reversion to landlord provisions
- Removal requirements
- Allowances and tenant improvement contributions

**State and Local Considerations**

*State-Specific Depreciation Rules:*
- State conformity to federal depreciation
- States decoupled from bonus depreciation
- State-specific recovery periods or methods
- Combined federal/state analysis

*Property Tax Implications:*
- Personal property vs. real property for property tax
- Potential property tax savings from reclassification
- State-specific property tax treatment
- Assessment implications

*State Conformity Issues:*
- States conforming to IRC as of specific date
- Non-conforming states requiring separate calculation
- Impact on overall benefit calculation
- Disclosure in report
