# Detailed Schedules (The "Meat" of the Report)

## Introduction

The detailed schedules constitute the core analytical content of a cost segregation study—the data tables and financial calculations that transform narrative methodology into quantifiable tax benefits. These schedules provide the detailed asset-by-asset breakdown that supports all conclusions, demonstrate mathematical precision through comprehensive reconciliations, and serve as the primary defense documentation during IRS examinations.

While the executive summary and narrative tell the story, the schedules prove the case with data. Every dollar must be accounted for, every allocation must be supported, and every calculation must be verifiable. The schedules are where theory meets practice and where professional judgment is translated into specific tax positions.

## Reconciliation Schedule (Critical)

The reconciliation schedule is arguably the most important single page in the entire cost segregation study because it proves that the analysis is complete and that every dollar has been properly accounted for.

**Purpose and Function**

The reconciliation schedule demonstrates that:
- Total cost analyzed equals taxpayer's basis in the property
- All costs are accounted for (nothing missing)
- Study results tie to taxpayer's accounting records
- Amounts reconcile to tax return depreciation schedules
- No mathematical errors exist in the allocation process

**Components of Reconciliation**

**Starting Point**
- Total project cost or acquisition price
- Source document reference (closing statement, construction budget)
- Taxpayer's recorded basis per books
- Tax return basis per Form 4562

**Adjustments to Basis**
- Section 1031 like-kind exchange adjustments
- Reductions for subsidies or grants
- Bonus depreciation previously claimed
- Section 179 expensing previously taken
- Other adjustments affecting depreciable basis

**Cost Segregation Allocation**
- 5-year property total
- 7-year property total
- 15-year property total
- 27.5-year or 39-year property total
- Land (non-depreciable)
- Total of all categories

**Reconciliation Proof**
- Sum of allocated categories = Total basis analyzed
- Variance (should be zero or immaterial)
- Explanation of any difference
- Cross-reference to taxpayer's records

**Format Example**

| Description | Amount | Source/Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Total Project Cost per Closing Statement | $5,000,000 | HUD-1, page 3 |
| Less: Land Value | ($1,000,000) | Appraisal dated XX/XX/XXXX |
| **Depreciable Basis - Building and Improvements** | **$4,000,000** | |
| | | |
| **Cost Segregation Allocation:** | | |
| 5-Year Personal Property | $600,000 | Schedule B |
| 7-Year Personal Property | $400,000 | Schedule B |
| 15-Year Land Improvements | $300,000 | Schedule B |
| 39-Year Real Property | $2,700,000 | Schedule B |
| **Total Allocated** | **$4,000,000** | |
| | | |
| **Reconciliation:** | | |
| Depreciable Basis | $4,000,000 | |
| Total Allocated | ($4,000,000) | |
| **Difference** | **$0** | |

## Schedule A: Asset Summary by Tax Category

Schedule A provides the high-level summary of reclassified assets, serving as the bridge between the executive summary and the detailed asset listings.

| | | | |
| **Total Depreciable Property** | | **$4,000,000** | **100.0%** |

## Schedule B: Detailed Asset Listing

Schedule B is the heart of the cost segregation study—the comprehensive, line-by-line inventory of every component identified, quantified, priced, and classified.

**Purpose**

To provide complete transparency and documentation for every asset reclassified, enabling independent verification and supporting audit defense.

**Required Columns**

**Asset Description**

- "Various items" (no specificity)
- "Personal property" (no description)
- "See drawings" (insufficient)

## Schedule C: Depreciation Schedules

Schedule C translates the asset reclassification into actual tax benefits by showing depreciation deductions over time under both the baseline (without cost segregation) and proposed (with cost segregation) scenarios.

**Purpose**

To demonstrate the specific tax benefit in dollar terms, year by year, and to calculate the Section 481(a) adjustment for catch-up depreciation.

**Current Depreciation** (Without Cost Segregation)

**Baseline Scenario:**
- Property treated as single 39-year asset (or 27.5-year for residential)
- Straight-line depreciation method
- Mid-month convention
- Annual depreciation amounts shown
- Typically 10-15 year projection

**Calculation:**
- Depreciable basis ÷ 39 years (or 27.5 years)
- First-year adjustment for mid-month convention
- Consistent annual depreciation in years 2-39

**Presentation:**

| Year | 39-Year Depreciation | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $94,017 | $94,017 |
| Year 2 | $102,564 | $196,581 |
| Year 3 | $102,564 | $299,145 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Year 10 | $102,564 | $1,017,078 |

**Proposed Depreciation** (With Cost Segregation)

**Enhanced Scenario:**
- Assets segregated by recovery period (5, 7, 15, 39-year)
- Accelerated methods where applicable:
  - 200% declining balance for 5-year and 7-year
  - 150% declining balance for 15-year
  - Straight-line for 39-year
- Bonus depreciation applied to qualifying property (if applicable and elected)
- Half-year or mid-quarter convention applied
- Annual depreciation amounts by category

**Calculation by Category:**

5-Year Property:
- First-year: Bonus (if applicable) + regular depreciation
- Subsequent years: 200% DB on remaining basis

7-Year Property:
- First-year: Bonus (if applicable) + regular depreciation
- Subsequent years: 200% DB on remaining basis

15-Year Property:
- First-year: 150% DB with half-year convention
- Subsequent years: 150% DB on remaining basis

39-Year Property:
- Straight-line over 39 years
- Mid-month convention

**Presentation:**

| Year | 5-Yr | 7-Yr | 15-Yr | 39-Yr | Total | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Yr 1 | $420,000 | $257,143 | $25,000 | $70,940 | $773,083 | $773,083 |
| Yr 2 | $112,000 | $175,510 | $47,500 | $77,114 | $412,124 | $1,185,207 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Comparison Table**

Side-by-side comparison showing the benefit:

| Year | Without Cost Seg | With Cost Seg | Annual Benefit | Cumulative Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $94,017 | $773,083 | $679,066 | $679,066 |
| Year 2 | $102,564 | $412,124 | $309,560 | $988,626 |
| Year 3 | $102,564 | $328,945 | $226,381 | $1,215,007 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Year 10 | $102,564 | $145,890 | $43,326 | $2,450,000 |

**Section 481(a) Adjustment Calculation**

**For Catch-Up Studies** (property already in service):

Cumulative depreciation that should have been claimed:
- Depreciation under proposed method from placed-in-service date to study date
- Calculated year-by-year
- Cumulative total

Cumulative depreciation actually claimed:
- Depreciation under old method (straight-line 39-year)
- From placed-in-service date to study date
- Cumulative total from tax returns

Net Section 481(a) Adjustment:
- Should have been claimed minus actually claimed
- Typically a positive adjustment (additional depreciation)
- Claimed in full in year of change
- No spread over multiple years (for favorable adjustments)

**Example Calculation:**

| Description | Amount |
|---|---|
| Depreciation that should have been claimed (proposed method, Yr 1-5) | $2,100,000 |
| Depreciation actually claimed (39-year SL, Yr 1-5) | $500,000 |
| **Section 481(a) Positive Adjustment** | **$1,600,000** |
