# Engineering Detail and Take-offs

## Introduction

For a cost segregation study to be considered a "quality study" by IRS standards and professional guidelines, the report must demonstrate that asset costs were not merely guessed or estimated using simplistic percentages, but were systematically measured, quantified, and priced using sound engineering principles. Engineering detail and quantity take-offs provide the technical credibility that distinguishes professional studies from superficial analyses.

The IRS Audit Techniques Guide emphasizes that detailed engineering approaches require actual measurement and calculation rather than broad-brush allocations. Quantity take-offs serve as the foundation for defensible cost estimates, provide a clear audit trail for verification, support cost allocations with objective data, and demonstrate the professional rigor expected in high-quality studies.

## Quantity Take-offs

Quantity take-offs are the systematic measurement and quantification of building components from construction documents, field observations, or a combination of both. They represent the engineering backbone of the cost estimation process.

**Purpose and Importance**

**Demonstrates Actual Measurement:**
- Proves components were measured, not estimated arbitrarily
- Shows professional engineering methodology
- Provides verifiable, objective data

- Traceable to source documents
- Reproducible by independent party
- Supports audit defense

**Supports Cost Allocations:**
- Quantities drive cost calculations
- Enables component-level pricing
- Supports allocation percentages
- Validates reasonableness of results

**Required for Detailed Engineering Methodology:**

## Level of Detail Considerations

**Balance Detail and Practicality**

The level of detail must be appropriate to the property size, complexity, and materiality of components:

**Don't Over-Engineer Small Items:**
- Grouping small, similar items is acceptable
- Immaterial items don't require extensive detail
- Focus effort on material components
- Cost-benefit of excessive detail

**Focus Detail on Material Items:**
- Significant systems analyzed in detail
- Large cost items receive greatest attention
- Unusual or unique items documented thoroughly
- Items likely to be questioned by IRS

**Group Insignificant Components:**
- Minor items grouped by type or system
- Summary-level treatment of immaterial items
- Reasonable thresholds for grouping vs. itemizing

**When to Summarize vs. Itemize**

**Itemize:**
- Significant systems (HVAC, electrical, etc.)
- Specialty equipment
- Unique or custom components
- Items with different recovery periods in same area
- Material individual assets (>1% of total cost)

**Summarize:**
- Repetitive small items (standard receptacles, switches)
- Standard finishes throughout (paint, VCT flooring)
- Minor accessories
- Immaterial components

**Materiality Thresholds**

Suggested thresholds for level of detail:
- Properties <$5M: detailed analysis for items >$25,000; group smaller items
- Properties $5M-$20M: detailed analysis for items >$50,000
- Properties >$20M: detailed analysis for items >$100,000
- Adjust based on property characteristics and complexity

Studies built on solid engineering principles withstand scrutiny and provide clients with confidence that their tax positions are well-supported.
