# Narrative: Project Scope and Methodology

## Introduction

The narrative section provides the comprehensive "story" of how the cost segregation study was conducted, documenting the entire process from initial engagement through final analysis. This section serves multiple critical purposes: it explains methodology selection and application, documents key decisions and their rationale, provides a complete audit trail, and demonstrates transparency in the analytical process.

Unlike the executive summary, which targets decision-makers seeking bottom-line results, the narrative is written for technical reviewers, tax professionals, and IRS agents who need to understand and validate the study's methodology and conclusions. This section must be thorough, well-organized, and sufficiently detailed to allow an independent professional to understand exactly how the study was performed.

## Project Description

## Methodology Declaration

The methodology declaration is one of the most critical elements of the narrative, as it establishes the technical foundation for the entire study and demonstrates compliance with IRS guidance.

**IRS-Recognized Methodologies**

The study must employ one (or a combination) of the IRS-recognized methods described in the Audit Techniques Guide:

**Detailed Engineering Approach (Actual Costs)**
