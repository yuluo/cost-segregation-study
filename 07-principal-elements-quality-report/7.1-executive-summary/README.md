# Executive Summary

## Purpose and Audience

The executive summary serves as a high-level overview designed specifically for decision-makers who need to quickly understand the study's findings and their financial impact. This section is crafted for the taxpayer, CFO, and CPA—professionals who may not have time to review the entire technical report but need to make informed decisions about the study's implementation.

The executive summary may be the only section that some stakeholders read, making it critical that this portion accurately conveys the study's value proposition and key findings. It sets the tone for the entire report and often determines the client's first impression of the work performed.

## Salient Facts

Every executive summary must clearly identify the fundamental facts of the engagement:

**Property Identification**
- Complete legal name and address of the property
- Property type and current use
- Total square footage or acreage
- Number of buildings or structures (if applicable)

**Study Parameters**
- Date the study was completed
- Placed-in-service date (acquisition or completion of construction)
- Date property was acquired or completed
- Cost segregation study effective date
- Tax year(s) affected

**Scope Definition**
- What was included in the analysis
- What was specifically excluded (and why)
- Basis analyzed (purchase price, construction costs, or both)
- Whether study covered entire property or specific components

## Required Elements

A complete executive summary must include the following components to meet professional standards:

**Property Description**
- Brief narrative of the property's physical characteristics
- Primary use and business operations conducted
- Construction type and quality level
- Age and general condition
- Notable features relevant to the study

**Study Objectives**
- Primary goal: accelerate depreciation deductions
- Tax planning objectives addressed
- Timing considerations (current year vs. catch-up)
- Integration with overall tax strategy

**Cost Basis Summary**
- Total project cost or acquisition price
- Land value allocation and methodology
- Depreciable basis subject to analysis
- Source of cost data (closing statement, construction records, etc.)

**Reclassification Results**
- Summary of assets moved from 39-year to shorter recovery periods
- Amount allocated to 5-year property
- Amount allocated to 7-year property
- Amount allocated to 15-year property (land improvements)
- Amount remaining as 27.5-year or 39-year property
- Percentage of total basis reclassified

**Tax Impact Statement**
- Total depreciation benefit over study period (typically 10-15 years)
- First-year tax impact (including bonus depreciation if applicable)
- Section 481(a) adjustment amount (catch-up depreciation)
- Cash flow impact in year one
- Net present value of total benefit
- Return on investment for study cost

**Methodology Declaration**
- IRS-recognized methodology employed
- Brief rationale for method selection
- Compliance with professional standards referenced

**Key Conclusions**
- Material findings that support the analysis
- Significant assumptions or limitations
- Recommendations for implementation

## Financial Results Presentation

The executive summary must present financial results in a clear, accessible format that allows non-technical readers to immediately grasp the study's value.

**Asset Reclassification Table**

A summary table showing the reallocation of costs typically includes:

| Asset Category | Recovery Period | Amount | Percentage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personal Property | 5-year | $XXX,XXX | XX% |
| Personal Property | 7-year | $XXX,XXX | XX% |
| Land Improvements | 15-year | $XXX,XXX | XX% |
| Real Property | 39-year | $XXX,XXX | XX% |
| **Total Depreciable Basis** | | **$X,XXX,XXX** | **100%** |

**Depreciation Comparison**

Side-by-side comparison of depreciation deductions:

| Year | Without Cost Seg | With Cost Seg | Annual Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $XX,XXX | $XXX,XXX | $XXX,XXX |
| Year 2-10 | [values] | [values] | [values] |
| 10-Year Total | $XXX,XXX | $X,XXX,XXX | $XXX,XXX |

**Tax Benefit Summary**

Clear presentation of the financial impact:
- Section 481(a) catch-up depreciation: $XXX,XXX
- Additional first-year depreciation (including bonus): $XXX,XXX
- Total first-year tax benefit (at XX% rate): $XX,XXX
- 10-year cumulative tax benefit: $XXX,XXX
- Net present value (at X% discount): $XXX,XXX

## Impact Statement

The impact statement translates technical findings into business value:

**Net Benefit Quantification**
- Total amount of depreciation accelerated from future years to present
- Time value of money advantage clearly articulated
- Cash flow improvement in current tax year
- Ongoing annual benefits in subsequent years

**Business Value Proposition**
- Cost of study vs. tax benefit generated
- Return on investment percentage
- Payback period for study cost
- Strategic tax planning advantages

**Implementation Considerations**
- Form 3115 filing requirement (automatic consent)
- Timing for filing with tax return
- Coordination with CPA/tax preparer
- State tax conformity issues (if applicable)

## Summary Tables Format

Professional presentation of summary data is essential for credibility and clarity.

**Asset Summary by MACRS Category**

Organized by recovery period with clear subtotals and grand totals that reconcile to the total depreciable basis.

**Tax Benefit Summary**

Year-by-year projection showing:
- Baseline depreciation (without study)
- Proposed depreciation (with study)
- Annual incremental benefit
- Cumulative benefit
- Present value calculations

**Depreciation Comparison Chart**

Visual representation (bar chart or line graph) comparing depreciation deductions over time with and without cost segregation. This provides immediate visual impact for decision-makers.

## Content Guidelines

To maximize effectiveness, the executive summary must adhere to specific content guidelines:

**Length Limitation**
- Strict maximum of 2-3 pages
- Typically 2 pages for straightforward studies
- 3 pages only for complex properties requiring additional context
- Every word must add value; eliminate unnecessary detail

**Language Standards**
- Clear, concise, business-oriented language
- Avoid technical jargon and complex tax terminology
- Define acronyms on first use
- Write for an intelligent non-specialist audience
- Active voice preferred over passive voice

**Visual Elements**
- Use tables for financial data presentation
- Include charts or graphs where they enhance understanding
- Professional formatting with adequate white space
- Consistent fonts and styling
- Color used strategically (if applicable)

**Key Findings Emphasis**
- Material findings prominently displayed
- Use bold text or callout boxes for critical information
- Highlight the "bottom line" tax benefit
- Make ROI immediately apparent

**Reference Architecture**
- Point readers to detailed sections for supporting information
- "See Section X for detailed analysis..."
- "Refer to Schedule B for complete asset listing..."
