# Section 179 Expensing

## Definition

Section 179 allows taxpayers to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and software up to a specific annual limit in the year the asset is placed in service, rather than depreciating it over time.

## Expanded Scope

### Real Property Improvements

Recent tax legislation expanded Section 179 to include specific "real property" improvements:

**Qualifying Real Property:**
- Roofs
- HVAC systems
- Fire protection and alarm systems
- Security systems

**Requirements:**
- Must be for non-residential real property (commercial buildings)
- Must be made after the building was first placed in service
- Subject to annual dollar limits

## Key Characteristics

### Annual Dollar Limits
- Maximum deduction amount (indexed for inflation)
- Subject to legislative changes
- Check current year limits for planning purposes

### Phase-Out Threshold
- Total deduction begins to phase out after aggregate equipment purchases exceed a threshold amount
- Dollar-for-dollar reduction above threshold
- Limits very large capital expenditure deductions

### Taxable Income Limitation
- Section 179 deduction cannot exceed taxable income
- Prevents creation of tax losses
- Unused amounts can be carried forward

### Primary Use
- Originally designed for equipment and personal property
- Expanded to include specific building systems
- Particularly valuable for small and medium-sized businesses
