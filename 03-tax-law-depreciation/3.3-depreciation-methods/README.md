# Depreciation Methods

## Overview

The depreciation method determines the rate at which an asset's value is written off over its recovery period. Different methods provide different patterns of cost recovery, with some methods front-loading deductions (accelerated methods) and others spreading deductions evenly over time.

## Accelerated Methods

### 200% Double Declining Balance (DDB)
- Typically used for 5, 7, and 10-year property
- Provides the most rapid cost recovery in early years
- Automatically switches to straight-line method when beneficial

### 150% Declining Balance
- Used for 15 and 20-year property
- Provides moderate acceleration compared to straight-line
- Also switches to straight-line method when beneficial

## Straight Line (SL)

The straight-line method spreads depreciation deductions evenly over the recovery period.

**Required for:**
- Real property (27.5 and 39-year property)
- Certain qualified improvements

**Optional for:**
- Any property where taxpayer elects straight-line method

## Established Depreciation Method

A depreciation method is considered "established" once a taxpayer has used it on two consecutive tax returns. Changing from an established method typically requires filing Form 3115 for a change in accounting method.
