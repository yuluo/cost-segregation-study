# Change of Accounting Method (Form 3115)

## When Form 3115 is Required

Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, is required when a cost segregation study is performed on a property placed in service in a prior year (commonly called a "look-back" study). This form allows the taxpayer to claim depreciation deductions that were missed in previous years.

## 481(a) Adjustment

The Section 481(a) adjustment is a critical mechanism that provides significant benefits for taxpayers conducting look-back cost segregation studies.

### Benefits
- Allows the taxpayer to take the entire "catch-up" depreciation in the current tax year
- Eliminates the need to amend prior-year returns
- Provides immediate tax benefit for missed depreciation

### Characteristics
- Prevents double-deduction or omission of income during method changes
- Can be substantial with cost segregation studies
- Calculated as the difference between depreciation that should have been taken and what was actually taken
- Takes into account all open tax years

## Automatic Consent

Most cost segregation-related accounting method changes qualify for automatic IRS consent procedures, simplifying the process significantly.

**Key Features:**
- No user fee required for automatic consent changes
- No advance IRS approval needed
- Filed with the timely-filed tax return (including extensions)
- Must meet specific procedural requirements outlined in Revenue Procedure guidance

## Timing Considerations

### Strategic Timing
- Can be filed for any open tax year
- Look-back studies for previously acquired property
- Coordinate with statute of limitations
- Consider current year income levels for maximum benefit

### Planning Factors
- Audit risk assessment
- Current and projected tax rates
- Availability of tax credits or loss carryforwards
- Cash flow and business planning considerations
