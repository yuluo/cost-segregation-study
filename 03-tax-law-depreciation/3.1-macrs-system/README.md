# MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System)

## What is MACRS?

MACRS is the current tax depreciation system required for all tangible property placed in service after December 31, 1986. The system consists of two primary depreciation systems that taxpayers may use depending on their specific circumstances and property types.

## General Depreciation System (GDS)

The General Depreciation System is the standard system used for most property and provides the most accelerated depreciation allowed under current tax law. GDS is the default system unless the taxpayer elects to use ADS or is required to use ADS for specific property types.

## Alternative Depreciation System (ADS)

The Alternative Depreciation System is required for specific properties and circumstances:

**Required for:**
- Properties financed with tax-exempt bonds
- Properties leased to tax-exempt entities
- Properties used predominantly outside the U.S.

**Characteristics:**
- Generally requires longer recovery periods than GDS
- Uses straight-line depreciation method
- May result in slower cost recovery than GDS
