# Depreciation Conventions

## Definition

Depreciation conventions determine how much depreciation is taken in the first and last years of an asset's life. These conventions establish the assumed date an asset was placed in service, which affects the amount of depreciation allowed in the year of acquisition and disposition.

## Half-Year Convention

Generally used for personal property (equipment, furniture, fixtures).

**Key Features:**
- Assumes the asset was placed in service at the mid-point of the tax year
- Allows one-half year of depreciation in the first year
- Allows one-half year of depreciation in the year of disposition
- Applies regardless of the actual date the asset was placed in service

## Mid-Quarter Convention

Required if more than 40% of the year's personal property additions (excluding real estate) are placed in service during the last three months of the tax year.

**Key Features:**
- Prevents manipulation by placing assets in service late in the year
- Assumes assets are placed in service at the mid-point of the quarter
- More complex calculation than half-year convention
- Depreciation amount varies based on quarter of acquisition

## Mid-Month Convention

Required for all 27.5 and 39-year real property.

**Key Features:**
- Assumes property was placed in service at the mid-point of the month
- Depreciation based on the number of full months the property was in service
- Applies to both residential and non-residential real property
