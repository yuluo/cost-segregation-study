# Tax Law and Depreciation

## MACRS System Overview

The Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) is the current method of depreciation for tax purposes in the United States.

### Key Features
- Established by Tax Reform Act of 1986
- Replaced ACRS system
- Provides standardized recovery periods and methods
- Applies to property placed in service after 1986

## Core Depreciation Elements

### 1. Recovery Period
The number of years over which property is depreciated:
- **5-year property**: Computers, office equipment, automobiles
- **7-year property**: Office furniture, machinery, equipment
- **15-year property**: Land improvements, restaurant property, retail improvements
- **27.5-year property**: Residential rental property
- **39-year property**: Commercial real property (non-residential)

### 2. Depreciation Method
- **200% Declining Balance**: 5-year and 7-year property
- **150% Declining Balance**: 15-year property
- **Straight-Line**: 27.5-year and 39-year property
- Option to elect straight-line for any property

### 3. Convention
Determines when depreciation begins:
- **Half-Year Convention**: Most property (assumes mid-year placement)
- **Mid-Quarter Convention**: Applies when >40% of property placed in service in last quarter
- **Mid-Month Convention**: Real property (27.5-year and 39-year)

## Special Provisions

## Change of Accounting Method

### Form 3115 Process
Used to implement cost segregation results:
- **Automatic consent procedure** for most changes
- Filed with timely-filed tax return
- No user fee for automatic changes
- IRC Section 481(a) adjustment

### Section 481(a) Adjustment
- Catches up missed depreciation from prior years
- Generally taken in year of change
- Prevents double-deduction or omission of income
- Can be substantial with cost segregation

### Timing Considerations
- Can be filed for open tax years
- Look-back studies for previously acquired property
- Coordinate with statute of limitations
- Consider audit risk and benefits
