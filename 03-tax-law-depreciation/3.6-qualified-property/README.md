# Qualified Property (QIP, QLI, QRP, QRIP)

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-05 (OBBBA 2025 - Permanent 100% bonus)

## Overview

Special categories of property often qualify for accelerated 15-year lives or bonus depreciation. These qualified property classifications provide more favorable tax treatment than standard 39-year commercial property depreciation.

## Qualified Improvement Property (QIP)

### Definition
Qualified Improvement Property represents interior improvements to non-residential real property that are made after the building was originally placed in service.

**Key Requirements:**
- Must be interior improvements
- Building must already be placed in service
- Does not include enlargement, elevator/escalator, or structural framework modifications

**Tax Treatment:**
- 15-year recovery period under MACRS
- Eligible for permanent 100% bonus depreciation (for property acquired after January 19, 2025, per OBBBA 2025)

## Historical Categories

Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, several specific categories existed with similar treatment:

### Qualified Leasehold Improvements (QLI)
- Improvements to the interior portion of a non-residential building
- Must be pursuant to a lease
- Generally qualified for 15-year recovery period

### Qualified Restaurant Property (QRP)
- Building improvements for restaurant use
- More than 50% of square footage dedicated to preparation and seating
- Eligible for 15-year recovery period

### Qualified Retail Improvement Property (QRIP)
- Interior improvements to retail space
- Building must be at least 3 years old at the time of improvement
- Qualified for 15-year recovery period

## Important Note

Most historical categories (QLI, QRP, QRIP) were eliminated or consolidated into the broader QIP category effective January 1, 2018, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The consolidated QIP definition provides similar benefits with simplified requirements.
