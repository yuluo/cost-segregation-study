# Bonus Depreciation

## Definition

Bonus depreciation allows for the immediate expensing of a percentage of an asset's cost in its first year of service, before regular MACRS depreciation is calculated. This powerful tax incentive provides significant front-loaded deductions for qualifying property.

## History

Bonus depreciation rates have fluctuated since its introduction in 2002, varying from 30% to 100% depending on the economic climate and legislative changes. The provision has been extended and modified multiple times through various tax acts.

## 100% Bonus Depreciation

### Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly expanded bonus depreciation:

**Qualifying Property:**
- Property with a recovery period of 20 years or less
- Both new and used property generally qualify
- Must meet original use or acquisition requirements

**Effective Dates:**
- Applies to property placed in service after September 27, 2017

### Phase-Out Schedule

Property placed in service:
- **2023:** 80% bonus depreciation
- **2024:** 60% bonus depreciation
- **2025:** 40% bonus depreciation
- **2026:** 20% bonus depreciation
- **2027 and beyond:** 0% (unless extended by legislation)

## Impact on Cost Segregation

Bonus depreciation significantly enhances the benefits of cost segregation studies by allowing immediate expensing of shorter-life assets identified through the study, rather than depreciating them over their full recovery periods.
