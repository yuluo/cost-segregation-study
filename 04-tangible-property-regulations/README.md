# Tangible Property Regulations

## Overview

The Tangible Property Regulations (TPR), finalized in 2013 and effective 2014, provide comprehensive rules for determining whether expenditures must be capitalized or may be expensed.

## Capitalization vs Expense Rules

### General Standards
- **Capitalize**: Costs that create new assets or provide future benefits
- **Expense**: Costs for repairs, maintenance, and incidental supplies
- **Key Test**: Does the expenditure result in betterment, adaptation, or restoration?

### De Minimis Safe Harbor
- Expense items below specified threshold
- Written policy required (typically $2,500 or $5,000)
- Must have applicable financial statement or meet other requirements
- Applied per invoice or item as substantiated

### Materials and Supplies
- Tangible property used or consumed in operations
- Can be expensed when used or consumed
- Includes components for maintenance and repairs
- Special rules for rotable, temporary, and standby emergency spare parts

## Units of Property (UOP)

### Definition
The appropriate level for determining whether costs are capitalized or expensed.

### Building UOP
Generally includes:
- Building structure
- Major structural components
- All systems (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.)

### Building Systems as UOP
Each system treated separately:
- **HVAC system**
- **Plumbing system**
- **Electrical system**
- **Fire protection and alarm**
- **Security system**
- **Gas distribution**
- **Other systems**

### Significance
- Determines scope of improvements vs repairs
- Affects capitalization decisions
- Impacts disposition analysis
- Critical for cost segregation planning

## Safe Harbors

### Routine Maintenance Safe Harbor
- Activities expected to be performed more than once during class life
- Keeps property in ordinary operating condition
- Not improvement if meets routine maintenance definition
- Must document frequency expectation

### Small Building Safe Harbor (Repealed)
- Previously allowed expensing of small building improvements
- No longer available after 2015
- Historical reference only

## Betterment-Adaptation-Restoration (BAR)

### Betterment
Capitalize if expenditure:
- Ameliorates material condition or defect
- Results in material addition (physical enlargement, expansion, extension)
- Results in material increase in capacity, productivity, efficiency, strength, or quality

### Adaptation
Capitalize if expenditure:
- Adapts UOP to new or different use
- Inconsistent with taxpayer's intended ordinary use at placed-in-service date

### Restoration
Capitalize if expenditure:
- Returns UOP to ordinary operating condition after deterioration to state of disrepair
- Rebuilds UOP to like-new condition
- Replaces major component or substantial structural part
- Realizes gain/loss on disposition of old component
- Restores damage for which basis adjustment taken

## Dispositions

### Partial Disposition Election
- Allows recognition of loss on retired building components
- Must be made timely (with return or amended return)
- Removes retired asset's remaining basis
- Critical for maximizing tax benefits

### General Asset Account (GAA) Rules
- Special disposition rules apply
- Generally no loss recognition without election
- Must track assets in GAAs separately
- Consider GAA termination elections

### Disposition Documentation
- Identify retired component
- Determine adjusted basis
- Calculate and recognize loss
- Update depreciation schedules
- Maintain supporting records
