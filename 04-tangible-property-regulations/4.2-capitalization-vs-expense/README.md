# Capitalization vs. Expense

## Core Distinction

The core of the TPR is distinguishing between incidental costs and permanent improvements.

## Section 162(a) - Expense

Costs are deductible as repairs if they:
- Are incidental in nature
- Keep property in an ordinarily efficient operating condition
- Do not materially add to value or substantially prolong life

## Section 263(a) - Capitalize

Costs must be capitalized if they are for permanent improvements or betterments that:
- Increase value, restore the property, or adapt it to a new use
- Must be depreciated over the asset's recovery period
