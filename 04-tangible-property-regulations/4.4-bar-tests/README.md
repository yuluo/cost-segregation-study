# The "BAR" Tests for Improvements

## Overview

To determine if a cost must be capitalized, apply the Betterment, Restoration, and Adaptation (BAR) tests:
- Applied to the relevant UOP or building system
- If any test is met, the cost must be capitalized

## Betterment

Costs must be capitalized if they:
- Ameliorate a material defect existing before the taxpayer acquired the property or arising during production
- Result in a material addition, including physical enlargement, expansion, extension, or addition of a major component
- Result in a material increase in productivity, efficiency, strength, quality, or output

## Restoration

Costs must be capitalized if they:
- Replace a component for which a loss or gain was recognized
- Return property to ordinary operating condition after it fell into a state of disrepair and is no longer functional
- Rebuild the property to like-new condition after the end of its class life
- Replace a major component or substantial structural part
- Involve an improvement for which basis was properly adjusted due to casualty loss

## Adaptation

Costs must be capitalized if they:
- Adapt property to a new or different use
- The use is inconsistent with the taxpayer's original intended ordinary use when the property was placed in service
