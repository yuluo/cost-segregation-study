# Safe Harbors

## Overview

Taxpayers can use three primary "safe harbors" to simplify tax compliance and avoid complex capitalization analysis when specific conditions are met.

## De Minimis Safe Harbor

Allows expensing of assets up to a certain dollar limit per invoice or item:
- **$5,000** for taxpayers with "Applicable Financial Statements" (AFS)
- **$2,500** for taxpayers without AFS
- Requires a written accounting policy in place at the beginning of the tax year
- Applied per invoice line item or per item as substantiated by invoice

## Routine Maintenance Safe Harbor

Allows expensing of maintenance activities that:
- The taxpayer reasonably expects to perform more than once during the asset's class life
- **OR** more than once in 10 years for buildings
- Activities that keep property in ordinarily efficient operating condition
- Examples: cleaning, inspection, testing, replacing parts

## Safe Harbor for Small Taxpayers

Available to taxpayers meeting specific criteria:
- **Gross receipts** of $10 million or less (average over prior 3 years)
- **Building basis** of $1 million or less (unadjusted)
- Total annual repair and improvement costs do not exceed the lesser of:
  - $10,000, **OR**
  - 2% of the building's unadjusted basis

### Benefits

- Entire amount can be expensed rather than capitalized
- Simplified recordkeeping
- Reduces compliance burden for small businesses
