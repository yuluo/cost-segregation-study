# Unit of Property (UOP)

## Critical Factor

The Unit of Property is the "critical factor" in determining if an expenditure is a repair or an improvement:
- Defines the baseline asset being worked on
- Changes scope of what constitutes a "replacement" vs. "repair"

## General Definition

A UOP is generally an asset where all components are "functionally interdependent":
- Example: A machine where one part cannot work without the others
- All interdependent parts are treated as a single unit

## Building UOP

A building is generally a single UOP. However, capitalization rules are applied at two levels:
- The building structure (envelope/frame)
- Any of the nine specifically enumerated building systems

## Nine Building Systems

1. HVAC system
2. Plumbing system
3. Electrical system
4. Escalators
5. Elevators
6. Fire protection and alarm systems
7. Security systems
8. Gas distribution system
9. Other systems identified in regulations
