# Dispositions and Partial Dispositions

## Overview

The regulations changed how taxpayers handle the removal of old property components, allowing recognition of losses on retired building components.

## Removal Costs

- Demolition and removal costs are generally deductible
- Must recognize a gain or loss on the removed component
- Coordinate with partial disposition election

## Partial Disposition Election

### Key Features

- Allows taxpayer to recognize a loss when a portion of an asset is disposed of
- Examples: old roof, elevator, HVAC system
- Can be made even if the entire building is not sold
- Must be made timely with the tax return

### Recognition Requirements

- Election is made by reporting the loss on a timely filed return for the year of disposition
- No special form required - reported on the return itself
- Can be made on an amended return for prior years (subject to limitations)

## Important Consequences

- If partial disposition election is made, the replacement component must be capitalized
- The retired component's remaining basis is removed from the asset
- Loss recognition provides immediate tax benefit
- Must maintain documentation supporting the retirement

## Strategic Considerations

- Coordinate with cost segregation studies
- Consider timing of replacements
- Document retirements thoroughly
- Evaluate impact on overall tax position
