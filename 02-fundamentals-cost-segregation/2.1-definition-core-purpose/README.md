# Definition and Core Purpose

## What is Cost Segregation?

Cost segregation is a specialized process used to identify and reclassify property components into qualified assets categorized as "tangible personal property" or "land improvements" under federal tax code.

## The Primary Goal

The primary goal of cost segregation is to identify all construction-related costs that can be depreciated over a shorter tax life:

- **Shorter lives**: 5, 7, or 15 years
- **Standard lives**: 39 years (non-residential) or 27.5 years (residential property)

## Tax Benefit

Cost segregation accelerates depreciation for significantly increased cash flow:

- Larger tax deductions in early years of property ownership
- Time value of money advantage
- Immediate improvement to cash flow position
