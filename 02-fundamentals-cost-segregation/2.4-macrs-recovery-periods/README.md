### Non-Residential Real Property

## Establishing a Depreciation Method

### Two Consecutive Year Rule

- A depreciation method is considered "established" once used on two consecutive tax returns
- Cannot be changed without IRS approval after establishment
- Important consideration when planning cost segregation timing

## Impact on Cost Segregation

- Key objective: Move costs from 27.5/39-year categories to 5/7/15-year categories
- Proper MACRS classification essential for tax benefit realization
