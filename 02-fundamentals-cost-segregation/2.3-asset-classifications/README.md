# Asset Classifications: Section 1245 vs. Section 1250

## Fundamental Requirement

Every cost segregation study must distinguish between two broad property categories as defined by Internal Revenue Code (IRC).

## Section 1245 Property

### Definition

- All tangible personal property
- "Other" tangible property used as integral part of:
  - Manufacturing operations
  - Production facilities
  - Research activities

### Characteristics

- Shorter depreciation lives (typically 5 or 7 years)
- Examples: machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures
- Includes special-purpose structures directly supporting production

## Section 1250 Property

### Definition

- Generally everything that is NOT Section 1245 property
- Real property classification

### Components

- The building structure itself
- Structural components:
  - Walls and foundations
  - Floors and ceilings
  - Basic plumbing and electrical systems
  - HVAC systems (unless special-purpose)
  - Roof structure

### Characteristics

- Longer depreciation periods
- 27.5 years for residential rental property
- 39 years for non-residential real property

## Critical Distinction

- Proper classification directly impacts depreciation schedule
- Misclassification can result in audit adjustments
- Professional judgment required for boundary cases
