# Bonus Depreciation

## Definition

Bonus depreciation allows immediate expensing of a large percentage of an asset's cost. The deduction is taken in the first year the asset is placed in service as an additional deduction on top of regular depreciation.

## Applicability

### Qualifying Property

Generally applies to assets with recovery period of **20 years or less**.

**Includes:**
- 5-year property (computers, vehicles, appliances)
- 7-year property (furniture, fixtures, equipment)
- 15-year property (land improvements, QIP)

### Exclusions

- Real property (buildings) with 27.5 or 39-year lives
- Property required to use Alternative Depreciation System (ADS)
- Certain listed property

## Historical Percentage Changes

### Significant Fluctuations

- Bonus depreciation percentage has changed frequently through legislation
- Used as economic stimulus tool during recessions
- Subject to sunset provisions requiring periodic renewal

### Recent History

**100% Bonus Depreciation:**
- Assets placed in service: September 28, 2017 through December 31, 2022
- Allowed immediate full expensing of qualifying property

### Phase-Out Schedule

- **2023**: 80% bonus depreciation
- **2024**: 60% bonus depreciation
- **2025**: 40% bonus depreciation
- **2026**: 20% bonus depreciation
- **2027 and beyond**: 0% (unless extended by legislation)

## Impact on Cost Segregation

### Dramatic Effect

- Cost segregation identifies 5, 7, and 15-year property
- These assets qualify for bonus depreciation
- Combined benefit can result in first-year deduction of majority of building costs

### Strategic Planning

- Timing of cost segregation study critical to maximize benefits
- Phase-out makes earlier studies more valuable
- Must consider property placement in service dates

### Legislative Risk

- Bonus percentages subject to change
- Congress may extend, modify, or eliminate
- Tax planning must account for current law and potential changes
