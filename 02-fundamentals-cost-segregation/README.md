# Fundamentals of Cost Segregation

## Definition

Cost segregation is an IRS-approved strategic tax planning tool that allows taxpayers to accelerate depreciation deductions by reclassifying assets from real property (39-year or 27.5-year) to personal property (5-year, 7-year, or 15-year) or land improvements (15-year).
