# The Study (Process) vs. The Report (Deliverable)

## ASCSP Distinction

The American Society of Cost Segregation Professionals (ASCSP) makes a clear separation between the technical work performed and the final product delivered.

## Cost Segregation Study (CSS)

**Definition**: The technical process of conducting the analysis

**Components**:
- Site observations and inspections
- Document reviews (construction records, blueprints, invoices)
- Engineering-based procedures
- Cost estimation and allocation
- Asset classification analysis

## Cost Segregation Report (CSR)

**Definition**: The deliverable—actual document provided to client

**Components**:
- Study methodology explanation
- Legal rationale and tax law application
- Final cost conclusions and classifications
- Supporting schedules and documentation
- Professional certification

## Key Difference

- **CSS** = The work and analysis performed
- **CSR** = The documented results and conclusions
