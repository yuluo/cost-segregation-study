# The "Whiteco" Tests (Permanency)

## Origin

Originating from *Whiteco Industries, Inc. v. Commissioner*, 65 T.C. 664 (1975), these six questions are used to determine if an asset is personal property (§1245) or a permanent land improvement/building component (§1250). While originally developed for outdoor advertising signs, the test has been applied broadly.

## The Six Whiteco Questions

### 1. Is the property capable of being moved, and has it in fact been moved?

**Considerations:**
- Actual mobility history is significant
- Prior moves indicate personal property nature
- Capability alone may not be sufficient

### 2. Is the property designed or constructed to remain permanently in place?

**Considerations:**
- Original design intent matters
- Temporary vs. permanent construction methods
- Foundation type and connection method

### 3. Are there circumstances which tend to show the expected or intended period of ownership being temporary?

**Considerations:**
- Business model considerations
- Lease terms vs. building life
- Industry practices for similar assets

### 4. How substantial a job is the removal of the property?

**Considerations:**
- Time and labor required
- Specialized equipment needed
- Complexity of disconnection

### 5. How much damage will the property sustain upon its removal?

**Considerations:**
- Destruction vs. reuse potential
- Damage to property itself
- Damage to surrounding structure

### 6. What is the manner of affixation to the land?

**Considerations:**
- Bolted vs. embedded
- Removable connections vs. permanent integration
- Foundation requirements

## Application

No single factor is determinative. Courts weigh all factors together. Greater mobility and removability favor §1245 treatment, while permanent nature and high removal costs favor §1250 treatment.

## Practical Examples

**Personal Property (§1245):**
- Outdoor signs (original case)
- Refrigeration systems (often movable, business-specific)
- Modular equipment with bolted connections
- Removable manufacturing fixtures

**Real Property/Structural (§1250):**
- Embedded concrete foundations
- Permanently integrated HVAC ductwork
- Built-in structural elements
- Items requiring demolition for removal

## Weighing the Factors

The Whiteco tests create a totality-of-circumstances analysis. An asset might score favorably on some factors and unfavorably on others. The court considers:
- Which factors are most relevant to the specific asset
- The weight of evidence on each side
- Industry standards and common practices
- Economic realities of the business
