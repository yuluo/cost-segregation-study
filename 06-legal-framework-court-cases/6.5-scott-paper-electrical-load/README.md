# Scott Paper Co. v. Commissioner (Electrical Load Analysis)

## Case Citation

*Scott Paper Company v. Commissioner*, T.C. Memo 1980-239

## The Issue

This case established how to handle "primary" building systems that serve both the building and specialized machinery. Specifically, how to allocate electrical system costs between building use and manufacturing use.

## Background

**Factual Context:**
- Manufacturing facility with substantial electrical infrastructure
- Electrical systems served both general building needs and production equipment
- Question: Can electrical distribution systems be split between §1245 and §1250?

## Court's Holding

**Summary:** The court allowed for the allocation of electrical system costs based on the electrical load (percentage of power) used by production machinery versus that used for general building lighting and outlets.

### Key Principles

**Electrical systems are not all-or-nothing:**
- Can be divided based on actual usage
- Shared infrastructure can be allocated
- Proportional allocation permitted

**Engineering analysis required:**
- Must determine actual allocation with technical support
- Load calculations provide objective basis
- Documentation must support allocation

**Burden on taxpayer:**
- Must prove business vs. building use
- Clear methodology required
- Reasonable and supportable allocation

## Methodology: Electrical Load Analysis

### Basic Approach

**Calculate total electrical capacity of the system:**
- Total service size (kVA or kW)
- Transformer capacity
- Main switchboard rating

**Determine capacity dedicated to production equipment:**
- Connected equipment load
- Demand factors applied
- Dedicated circuits and panels

**Determine capacity dedicated to building operations:**
- Lighting load
- HVAC load
- General outlets and convenience power

**Allocate costs proportionally:**
- Apply percentage to shared infrastructure
- Segregate 100% dedicated systems
- Document allocation basis

## Practical Application: "Load Studies"

### What is a Load Study?

Cost segregators use "Load Studies" to determine what percentage of a main switchboard or transformer can be classified as 5-year property.

### Components Analyzed

**Service entrance equipment:**
- Main switchboard
- Service transformers
- Metering equipment
- Main disconnects

**Distribution panels:**
- Separate panels for equipment vs. building
- Panel schedules showing circuit purposes
- Feeder circuits to panels

**Branch circuits:**
- Individual circuits traced to end use
- Dedicated equipment circuits
- General building circuits

**Conduit and wiring:**
- Allocated based on circuit purpose
- Proportional to load served
- Dedicated vs. shared pathways

## Load Study Process

### Step 1: System Inventory

**Identify all electrical components:**
- Service entrance to end use
- Transformers, switchgear, panels
- Feeders and branch circuits
- Complete one-line diagram

### Step 2: Load Calculation

**Determine total connected load:**
- Sum all equipment nameplate ratings
- Sum all lighting and receptacle loads
- Total kVA or kW

**Calculate demand load:**
- Apply appropriate demand factors
- Equipment: actual operating load
- Building: NEC demand calculations

### Step 3: Circuit Tracing

**Trace panels to determine what they serve:**
- Panel schedules analysis
- Physical verification
- Circuit directory review

**Identify dedicated equipment circuits:**
- 100% equipment-serving panels
- Direct feeds to machinery
- Process-specific circuits

**Identify general building circuits:**
- Lighting panels
- Receptacle circuits
- HVAC controls

### Step 4: Allocation

**Calculate percentage serving equipment vs. building:**
- Equipment load ÷ Total load = Equipment %
- Building load ÷ Total load = Building %

**Apply percentage to common infrastructure:**
- Service equipment
- Main switchboard
- Service transformers
- Shared feeders

**Segregate dedicated systems 100%:**
- Equipment-only panels: 100% §1245
- Building-only panels: 100% §1250
- Shared infrastructure: allocated

## Example Calculation

```
Total Electrical Service: 2,000 kVA

Manufacturing Equipment Load: 1,400 kVA (70%)
Building Operations Load: 600 kVA (30%)

Service Equipment Cost: $100,000
Equipment Portion (5-year): $70,000
Building Portion (39-year): $30,000

Dedicated Equipment Panel: $15,000
Classification: 100% 5-year property

Dedicated Lighting Panel: $8,000
Classification: 100% 39-year property
```

## Documentation Requirements

**Electrical drawings:**
- One-line diagrams
- Service entrance details
- Distribution layout
- Panel locations

**Panel schedules showing circuit uses:**
- Circuit-by-circuit listing
- Load on each circuit
- Purpose of each circuit
- Connected equipment

**Load calculations from engineer:**
- Demand calculations
- Diversity factors applied
- Supporting calculations
- Professional seal

**Site verification of actual uses:**
- Physical inspection
- Panel schedule verification
- Equipment nameplate confirmation
- As-built conditions

**Reconciliation to total costs:**
- Allocations tie to actual installed costs
- Cost breakdowns by component
- Supporting invoices
- Installation documentation

## Application to Other Systems

Similar allocation principles apply to:

**Plumbing systems:**
- Process piping vs. sanitary plumbing
- Dedicated process water vs. general domestic water
- Specialized systems vs. standard fixtures

**HVAC systems:**
- Process cooling vs. comfort cooling
- Equipment-specific systems vs. general building HVAC
- Tonnage allocation based on loads

**Gas distribution:**
- Process gas vs. building heating gas
- Dedicated equipment feeds vs. general service
- Capacity allocation

## Audit Considerations

**IRS Acceptance:**
- Load studies generally well-accepted when properly documented
- Engineering credentials important
- Clear methodology and calculations required
- Must reconcile to actual installed costs

**Common Challenges:**
- Demand factors must be reasonable
- Allocation percentages must be supportable
- Cannot allocate more than 100% of capacity
- Must distinguish dedicated from shared systems

**Best Practices:**
- Licensed engineer performs analysis
- Clear documentation of methodology
- Physical verification of systems
- Reconciliation to costs
- Conservative demand factors

## Key Takeaways

1. **Allocation is permitted:** Shared electrical systems can be split
2. **Engineering basis required:** Load studies provide objective support
3. **Documentation is critical:** Detailed calculations and verification needed
4. **Proportional allocation:** Based on actual loads, not arbitrary percentages
5. **Well-accepted methodology:** Load studies are standard practice in cost segregation
