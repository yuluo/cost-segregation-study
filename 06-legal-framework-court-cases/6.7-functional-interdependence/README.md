# Functional Interdependence

## Overview

This legal concept is used to define the "Unit of Property" (UOP). Critical for determining whether items are treated as a single asset or multiple separate assets. Important for both depreciation and disposition analysis.

## Definition

**Functional Interdependence:** Components are considered functionally interdependent if the placing in service of one component is dependent on the placing in service of another.

**Key Concept:** Items that cannot function without each other should be treated as a single unit of property.

## Legal Framework

### Regulatory Basis

**Defined in Tangible Property Regulations:**
- Treas. Reg. § 1.263(a)-3(e)(3)
- Applied in determining units of property under repair regulations
- Relevant for cost segregation asset grouping
- Critical for disposition analysis

### Three Tests for Identifying UOP

**1. Functionally Interdependent:**
- Cannot function without each other
- Operational dependency
- Technical integration
- System requirements

**2. Placed in Service Together:**
- Same operational timeline
- Simultaneous commissioning
- Integrated startup
- Common in-service date

**3. Reasonable Expectation:**
- Expected to be replaced together
- Similar useful lives
- Maintained as single system
- Retired as a unit

## Application Examples

### Functionally Interdependent - Single UOP

**Computer and its operating system:**
- Software required for hardware to function
- Integrated system
- Cannot operate independently

**HVAC chiller and cooling tower:**
- Chiller requires heat rejection
- Cooling tower provides that function
- System cannot operate without both
- Treated as single UOP

**Boiler and burner assembly:**
- Burner required to generate heat
- Boiler contains and transfers heat
- Interdependent components
- Single heating system UOP

**Elevator car, motor, and control system:**
- All components required for operation
- Cannot function independently
- Integrated transportation system
- Single elevator UOP

**Manufacturing line components:**
- Integrated production process
- Sequential operations
- Cannot function independently
- Single production line UOP

### Not Functionally Interdependent - Separate UOP

**Building electrical system and specific machinery:**
- Machinery could connect to different electrical source
- Electrical system serves multiple purposes
- Independent functions
- Separate UOPs

**HVAC system and manufacturing equipment:**
- Equipment could operate with different HVAC
- HVAC serves general building needs
- Independent systems
- Separate UOPs

**Parking lot and building:**
- Each can function independently
- Separate purposes
- Different useful lives
- Separate UOPs

**Multiple independent machines in a facility:**
- Each machine operates independently
- Separate functions
- Individual UOPs
- Not a single system

## Importance in Cost Segregation

### Asset Classification

**Functionally interdependent items classified together:**
- Same recovery period for entire UOP
- Cannot split components
- Uniform treatment required
- System-level classification

**Cannot split components into different recovery periods:**
- Integrated system has single classification
- All components follow system classification
- No cherry-picking of components
- Technical analysis determines system nature

**Must consider system as a whole:**
- Evaluate complete UOP
- System purpose drives classification
- Component-by-component analysis inappropriate
- Holistic approach required

### Example: Manufacturing Line

```
Components:
- Conveyor system
- Processing equipment
- Control systems
- Safety interlocks

Analysis: All are functionally interdependent
- Cannot operate without all components
- Integrated production process
- Placed in service together
- Maintained as single system

Classification: Single UOP, likely 7-year property
- Entire line classified uniformly
- Cannot separate conveyor as 5-year if equipment is 7-year
- System classification applies to all components
```

## Disposition Analysis

### Importance for Dispositions

**When property is removed, must identify UOP:**
- Disposition at UOP level, not component level
- Cannot claim partial disposition of sub-components
- Must remove entire UOP or none
- Critical for partial disposition elections

**Partial disposition rules apply at UOP level:**
- Treas. Reg. § 1.168(i)-8
- Must dispose of entire UOP
- Cannot claim disposition of components within UOP
- Proper UOP identification critical

**Cannot claim disposition of sub-components separately:**
- If removing part of UOP, not a disposition
- Must remove functional UOP
- Component replacement is repair/improvement analysis
- Different tax treatment implications

### Example: HVAC Replacement

```
Original UOP: Entire HVAC system (placed in service together)
- Rooftop units
- Ductwork
- Controls
- Thermostats

Disposition Question: Replacing rooftop units only - partial disposition?

Analysis: Depends on whether units are separate UOP or part of larger system

Scenario 1: Units are separate UOP
- Yes, can claim disposition of units
- Ductwork and controls remain in service
- Units were independent UOP

Scenario 2: Entire system is single UOP
- No disposition of units alone
- Replacement is improvement to existing UOP
- Analyzed under repair regulations
- Must dispose of entire system for disposition treatment
```

## Practical Considerations

## Impact on Bonus Depreciation

### Original Use

**Functionally interdependent used components don't qualify for bonus:**
- Must be new for bonus depreciation
- Used component taints entire UOP
- All-or-nothing rule
- New vs. used critical

**Entire UOP must be new for bonus depreciation:**
- Cannot bonus new component of used system
- System-level analysis
- Original use requirement
- All components must be new

**Cannot claim bonus on new component of used system:**
- UOP includes all interdependent components
- New component doesn't create new UOP
- Improvement to existing UOP
- No bonus on improvement

### Qualified Improvement Property

**QIP treatment depends on proper UOP identification:**
- What constitutes the improvement?
- UOP boundaries matter
- System vs. component analysis
- Classification implications

**Improvements to existing UOP may not qualify:**
- Must be improvement to building
- Not improvement to existing system
- UOP analysis critical
- Proper identification required

**New separate UOP may qualify:**
- If creates new independent system
- Not part of existing UOP
- Meets QIP requirements
- Proper analysis required

## Interaction with Other Concepts

### Whiteco Tests

**Functional interdependence relevant to removability analysis:**
- Interdependent systems harder to claim as removable
- Must remove entire UOP
- Impacts permanency analysis
- Removal complexity increased

**Interdependent systems harder to claim as removable:**
- Cannot remove one component
- Entire system must be moved
- Practical difficulties
- Weighs toward permanence

### Sole Justification

**Must consider whether entire UOP serves business or building:**
- System-level analysis
- Cannot split interdependent system between §1245 and §1250
- Predominant purpose of complete UOP
- Uniform classification

**Cannot split interdependent system between §1245 and §1250:**
- All components follow UOP classification
- System purpose determines all components
- No component-level splitting
- Technical analysis required
