# Section 1245 vs. Section 1250 Property

## Introduction

This is the foundational legal distinction in cost segregation. Understanding the difference between §1245 and §1250 is critical for proper asset classification.

## Section 1245 Property

Generally encompasses tangible personal property and "other tangible property" (excluding buildings and structural components). Used as an integral part of specific activities like manufacturing or production.

**Characteristics:**
- Shorter recovery periods (5, 7, or 15 years)
- Eligible for accelerated depreciation methods (200% declining balance for 5 and 7-year property)
- Subject to full ordinary income recapture upon sale

**Examples:**
- Machinery and equipment
- Furniture and fixtures
- Carpeting
- Removable partitions
- Process-specific systems

## Section 1250 Property

Primarily consists of "real property," which includes the building's shell and its structural components. Structural components are those needed for the general operation and maintenance of the building.

**Characteristics:**
- Depreciated over 27.5 years (residential) or 39 years (nonresidential)
- Must use straight-line depreciation method
- Partial recapture treatment (25% rate on unrecaptured §1250 gain)

**Examples:**
- Building shell (walls, roof, foundation)
- Central HVAC systems
- Standard plumbing
- General electrical wiring
- Structural framing

## Key Distinctions

| Aspect | §1245 Property | §1250 Property |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Recovery Period | 5/7/15 years | 27.5/39 years |
| Depreciation Method | Accelerated (200% DB) | Straight-line |
| Recapture | Full ordinary income | Partial (25% unrecaptured gain) |
| Function | Business operations | Building structure |

## Tax Impact

Proper classification can accelerate depreciation deductions by decades, providing significant present value benefits from front-loading deductions. Cost segregation studies identify components that can be reclassified from §1250 to §1245.

**Benefits of §1245 Classification:**
- Faster write-off period
- Higher depreciation in early years
- Improved cash flow
- Potential bonus depreciation eligibility
