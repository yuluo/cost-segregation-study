# Legal Framework and Court Cases

## Section 1245 vs Section 1250 Property

### Section 1245 Property (Personal Property)
**Characteristics:**
- Tangible personal property
- Subject to depreciation or amortization
- Shorter recovery periods (5, 7, or 15 years)
- Accelerated depreciation methods available

**Examples:**
- Machinery and equipment
- Furniture and fixtures
- Office equipment
- Special-purpose structures
- Land improvements (15-year)

**Recapture Rules:**
- Gain on sale taxed as ordinary income to extent of depreciation taken
- Prevents conversion of ordinary deductions to capital gains

### Section 1250 Property (Real Property)
**Characteristics:**
- Real property (buildings and structural components)
- Longer recovery periods (27.5 or 39 years)
- Straight-line depreciation
- Inherently permanent structural components

**Examples:**
- Building shell and structure
- Walls, floors, ceilings
- Roof structure
- Foundation
- Permanent coverings

**Recapture Rules:**
- Unrecaptured Section 1250 gain (25% rate)
- Only excess over straight-line depreciation recaptured as ordinary income

## Classification Tests and Principles

### Inherently Permanent Structural Component Test (Whiteco)
**Three-Factor Test:**
1. **Passive Function**: Component performs passive function (not active business function)
2. **Permanent**: Component intended to remain in place indefinitely
3. **Substantial Costs**: Removal would involve substantial costs

**Application:**
- If all three factors met, component is structural (§1250)
- Failure of any factor suggests personal property (§1245)
- Court emphasized substance over form

### Sole Justification Test
**Principle:**
If a component's sole justification is to serve the taxpayer's business operations (not building support), it may be personal property.

**Key Questions:**
- Does component exist solely for business operations?
- Could building function structurally without component?
- Is component specific to tenant's business?

**Examples:**
- Restaurant equipment built-in for food service
- Specialized flooring for manufacturing
- Refrigeration systems for cold storage

### Functional vs Structural Test
**Distinction:**
- **Structural**: Supports or encloses building
- **Functional**: Facilitates business operations

**Impact on Classification:**
- Structural components → §1250 (39-year)
- Functional components → §1245 (shorter recovery)

## Key Legal Principles

### Substance Over Form
Courts look to economic substance and business purpose, not merely legal form or physical attachment.

### Taxpayer Favorable Trend
Recent court decisions have generally favored broader personal property classifications when properly supported.

### Importance of Documentation
Strong factual records and expert testimony are critical for sustaining positions on audit or litigation.

### Engineering and Technical Analysis
Courts respect detailed engineering analysis and cost studies prepared by qualified professionals.
