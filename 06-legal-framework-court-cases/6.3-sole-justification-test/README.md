# The "Sole Justification" Test

## Overview

This test determines if a building system (like HVAC or electrical) that would normally be §1250 can be reclassified as §1245. The focus is on the primary purpose and beneficiary of the system.

## The Test

**Concept:** If a component is required solely to meet the unique temperature, humidity, or power requirements of a specific piece of machinery or a production process—rather than for the comfort of the building's occupants—it may qualify as §1245 property.

## Key Questions

- What is the primary purpose of this system?
- Who or what benefits from this system?
- Could the building function structurally without this component?
- Is the system necessary for the business operation or the building operation?

## "Sole" vs. "Primary"

Courts have interpreted "sole" somewhat flexibly:
- If the predominant purpose is business operations, may qualify
- Incidental building benefit does not disqualify
- Must show clear business necessity
- The primary driver determines classification

## Key Case: Piggly Wiggly Southern, Inc. v. Commissioner

Validated the test for HVAC units serving specialized supermarket equipment:
- Refrigeration systems for food storage held to be personal property
- Even though they provided some incidental environmental benefit
- Business necessity was the predominant driver
- Demonstrated practical application of the test

## Application Examples

### Qualifies as §1245

**Process cooling systems for manufacturing equipment:**
- Dedicated chillers for injection molding machines
- Precision temperature control for electronics manufacturing
- Heat removal systems for industrial processes

**Specialized HVAC for server rooms or data centers:**
- 24/7 cooling for IT equipment
- Precise temperature and humidity control
- Redundant systems for uptime requirements

**Refrigeration systems for food service or storage:**
- Walk-in coolers and freezers
- Display case refrigeration
- Food preparation cooling systems

**Clean room environmental systems:**
- HEPA filtration for pharmaceutical manufacturing
- Positive pressure systems
- Contamination control systems

**Equipment-specific electrical distribution:**
- Dedicated circuits for machinery
- Power conditioning for sensitive equipment
- High-voltage feeds for production equipment

### Remains §1250

**General building HVAC for occupant comfort:**
- Standard heating and cooling for offices
- Ventilation for general occupancy
- Comfort systems for common areas

**Standard electrical service for lighting and outlets:**
- General lighting circuits
- Convenience outlets
- Standard power distribution

**Basic plumbing for restrooms and general use:**
- Sanitary plumbing
- Domestic water service
- Standard fixtures

**Fire suppression for building code compliance:**
- Sprinkler systems (building-wide)
- Fire alarm systems
- Code-required safety systems

## Documentation Requirements

Successful application of the sole justification test requires:

**Engineering analysis of system purpose:**
- Technical specifications
- Design criteria and parameters
- Performance requirements

**Load calculations or capacity studies:**
- Equipment load vs. building load
- System sizing justification
- Capacity allocation analysis

**Business operational requirements:**
- Process requirements documentation
- Industry standards
- Operational necessity evidence

**Comparison to standard building systems:**
- Exceeds typical building requirements
- Specialized vs. standard components
- Cost differential analysis
